                        <core:para>The main change effected by this section is that by virtue of sub-s (2) of s 40 it is now possible for those born British to be deprived of their citizenship. However, because sub-s (4) requires that deprivation under that paragraph cannot be made where this would leave the person stateless, only those holding dual nationality will be affected by this new provision. An interesting question thus arises as to the relationship between this section and s 6 (see note thereto) which removes the exemption of nationality functions from the general prohibition on discrimination contained in the Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000), and now replaced by the Equality Act 2010. All those affected will be British nationals, but will hold another nationality, which could give rise to arguments that the section is discriminatory in its effect, although Ministers stated that the intention behind the section was to remove an unjustified distinction between those registered or naturalised as British, and those who acquired British nationality by birth (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> HL Report, 10 October 2002, Vol 639, No 184, Col 502).</core:para>

                           <core:emph typestyle="it">(1)</core:emph> The phrase in new s 40(2), ‘seriously prejudicial to the vital interests’, is taken from the European Convention on Nationality (Strasbourg, 6 September 1997) which Ministers indicated during the passage of the Act that it was their intention to ratify. The phrase is not defined in the Convention.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Section 40(6) means that the new s 40 has retrospective effect only in cases where nationality has been obtained by fraud, false representation or concealment (as set out in s 40(2)); cases which could have resulted in deprivation of nationality under the old s 40 of the BNA 1981. The new powers set out in s 40(2) do not therefore have retrospective effect.</core:para>
                        <core:para>New s 40A provides, for the first time, a right of appeal against deprivation of citizenship. The old s 40 provided only a right to an inquiry and for the Secretary of State to appoint a committee of inquiry. The appeal is to an immigration judge of the First-tier Tribunal in the first instance, with a right to seek leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeals Tribunal on a point of law and thence to seek leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal or the Court of Session. In national security cases, there is provision for the appeal to be heard by the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC).</core:para>
                        <core:para>New s 40A(6) provides that a deprivation order may not be made until any appeal has been finally determined, or the time for appealing has expired.</core:para>

Thus the powers in new s 40(2) to deprive those born British of their citizenship do not have retrospective effect. Those naturalised or registered as British could still be deprived of their citizenship under the new s 40(2) but only on the grounds set out in the old s 40(3), which can be broadly summarised as disloyalty to the sovereign; unlawful communication with the enemy, or a sentence of imprisonment in any country of more than 12 months, within five years of registration or naturalisation.</core:para>

Under ss 10(1) and 22(1) only women were entitled to register under these sections on the basis that they had been married before commencement of that Act to a person entitled to register as a British citizen by virtue of an appropriate qualifying connection (whether or not the spouse was still alive). The effect of this section is to give men the same entitlement. Discrimination is removed by giving men the (superior) rights previously enjoyed only by women. Spouses of both sexes of British or British overseas territories citizens who renounced that British or British overseas territories citizenship before commencement of the BNA 1981, but still fulfil the qualifying requirements, have the right to regain the citizenship renounced.</core:para>

                        <core:para>7 November 2002 in relation to a child born on or after 1 July 2006: see SI 2006/1498. Section 50(9A)(b)-(c) has been amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008.</core:para>

                        <core:para>Section 50(9) of the BNA 1981 states that ‘subject to s 47, the relationship of father and child shall be taken to exist only between a man and any legitimate child born to him’. Section 47 made provision for children legitimated (according to the law of their place of birth) by the marriage of their parents subsequent to their birth. Illegitimate children did not have fathers as far as the BNA 1981 was concerned. The effect of this section is to allow those proved to be fathers, by DNA testing or otherwise, to be recognised as the fathers of their illegitimate children for nationality purposes. Other differences in the treatment of legitimate and illegitimate children for nationality purposes are removed, as set out below.</core:para>
                        <core:para>As to the tests to be applied, the government stated during the passage of the Act that:</core:para>

                           <core:para>our expectation in most cases will be that, where the child was not born during the continuance of a marriage and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act does not apply, paternity will be proved by DNA evidence. Our intention is to adapt, for this purpose, the non-statutory scheme which has for many years operated successfully in the entry clearance context…, where a requirement to produce DNA evidence would be inappropriate, for example, where the alleged father had died…other evidence such as judicial declarations of paternity would need to be considered …there will need to be some flexibility in the application of the prescribed requirements</core:para>

                        <core:para>This section goes some way toward eliminating discrimination in naturalisation law. Prior to 1983, only fathers could transmit their British nationality to children born in wedlock outside the UK. Mothers could not. On 6 February 1979 a policy was introduced to register the children born outside the UK to British mothers as long as the children were still under 18. The discrimination did not affect children born after 1983, as s 2 of the BNA 1981 came into force on 1 January 1983, providing for such children to be born British by descent.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Not everyone who was eligible took advantage of the concession, which applied only during their minority. This provision essentially placed the old concession on a statutory footing: those who were minors when the concession came into force (ie those born after 7 February 1961) could now apply to register as British citizens. They would be British citizens by descent (sub-s (2)).</core:para>
                        <core:para>Discrimination on the face of the statute persisted, for those born to British mothers before 7 February 1961 had not been given a right to register and remain disadvantaged in comparison to those born to British fathers. However, s 4C was amended by the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, s 45 from 13 January 2010 so that children born before 7 February 1961 could also avail themselves of the entitlement to registration</core:para>

                     <core:para>This part provides for the establishment of new centres, called accommodation centres, where asylum-seekers would live for part, or all, of the time taken to determine their claims. There is also power (see notes to ss 23(3) and 23(5)), to accommodate people who are not asylum seekers in the centres, using the powers in s 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (IAA 1999). Most of Part 2 has not, however, been brought into force, and it seems unlikely that this expensive project will ever come to fruition.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The government envisages that asylum seekers will first go through the process of induction provided for by s 70, then pass into self-contained centres, where all facilities would be on site and asylum interviews and, in most cases, appeals, will be conducted on site. Possible locations so far identified have all been in remote rural locations and planning applications have been submitted. The government stated during the passage of the Act that it intended to pilot some four such centres, holding a total of 3,000 men, women and families, in the first instance. Unaccompanied minors will not go into centres. It appears highly unlikely that the pilot will commence before late 2004 and even then the majority of asylum-seekers will remain outside the centres, provided for by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS), and the system established under Pt 4 of the IAA 1999 and modified by Part 3 of this Act.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The overall effect of this Part, reinforced by the amendments to Pt 4 of the IAA 1999 effected by Pt 3 of this Act, is to strengthen the links between support and immigration control. The distinction between a residence restriction imposed under Sch 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 and a condition of support, or compliance with arrangements made for support is, for most practical purposes, removed.</core:para>

Indeed, a single application may suffice for both purposes, given that under s 51 of this Act it is for the Secretary of State, not the applicant, to determine which form of support will be offered. For existing applications, see the Asylum Support Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/704), reg 3 as amended, most recently by the Asylum Support (Amendment) (No 3) Regulations 2002, SI 2002/3110.</core:para>

See s 22, whereby supporting an asylum seeker in an accommodation centre is made one of the ways in which the Secretary of State may provide support under s 95 of the IAA 1999.</core:para>

There is no mention of the person’s having to satisfy any test of destitution or having to be an asylum seeker. Potential conflicts with s 17 are resolved by sub-s (5): such persons can be accommodated using the powers set out in s 4 of the IAA 1999, as amended by s 49 of this Act, which does not contain any test of destitution, and does not require those accommodated to be asylum-seekers. Note also that s 4 does not require the persons accommodated to be over 18.

Further circumstances in which support can be withdrawn may be specified in regulations made under s 26(2). Section 30 provides for conditions of residence to be imposed upon those residing in centres. The overall effect of this section is to turn conduct necessary to avoid s 35 offences, and compliance with directions to travel and with the conditions under which support is provided, into forms of residence restriction. If breach results in being made to leave the centre, the person will thereby have breached the residence restriction and be liable to arrest under the IA 1971, Sch 2, para 24, and to detention. Support and immigration control are nowhere more closely linked than by this provision.</core:para>

Section 4 of the IAA Act 1999 provides a power to accommodate those on temporary admission, released from immigration detention, on bail from immigration detention or, as a consequence of the amendments effected by s 49 of this Act, asylum seekers whose claims have been rejected. Thus accommodation centres need not be used wholly, or even mainly, for those with outstanding applications for asylum, or indeed those who have at any stage made a claim for asylum. The centres could be used for other categories of immigrants.</core:para>

                              <core:emph typestyle="it">(3) and (4)</core:emph> During the passage of the Act, the government were urged to include ‘access to legal advice’ among the facilities listed. They declined to do so, arguing that legal advice was provided by the LCD, through the Legal Services Commission, and that the list in subs (1) was not concerned with facilities that could be made available under other powers. They introduced subs (3) instead. This did not satisfy those arguing for access to legal advice to be included in the list and therefore the government subsequently introduced what is now subs (4). Ministers insisted throughout the passage of the Act that it was their intention that residents of an accommodation centre should have access to legal advice, including legal advice on-site; their concern was that the imposition of a duty might present opportunities for delay on the part of the person accommodated. The meaning of reasonable steps will fall to be determined by a court. Ministers stated that they would not always delay an interview to give an asylum-seeker the opportunity to obtain legal representation, but it will be for the courts to determine whether the failure to delay was reasonable in an individual case (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> HL Report, 9 October 2002, Vol 639, No 183, Col 398, Lord Filkin, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department). Paragraph 91 of the Explanatory Notes to the Act glosses sub-s (4) as requiring the Secretary of State ‘to take reasonable steps to ensure that a resident has an opportunity to obtain legal advice before the appointment made for his substantive interview’. Such a reading would appear to be an unwarranted restriction upon the scope of the sub-s which on its face covers any interview the purpose of which is to obtain information relevant to the determination of the application for asylum.</core:para>

                           <core:para>Immigration is a power reserved to the Westminster parliament; community care and other support functions are devolved powers, as is education. The government have taken the view since the passage of Part 6 of the IAA 1999 that support for asylum-seekers falls within ‘immigration’ and this has never been tested in the Scots courts. This section encroaches further into the powers of the Scots parliament, allowing Westminster to ‘apply, disapply or modify’ the effect of any enactment by the Scots parliament. While there is an obligation under subs (1) to consult with the Scots ministers before establishing an accommodation centre in Scotland, there is no equivalent obligation to consult before disapplying or modifying enactments of the Scots Parliament in relation to education.</core:para>

                        <core:para>This section amends ss 94 and 95 of the IAA 1999, which form the basis of the Home Office National Asylum Support Service (NASS) support scheme for asylum seekers. The amendments do not make huge changes in the operation of the support scheme, but any potential benefits of simplification are largely cancelled out by piecemeal version of the amendments and the failure to consolidate.</core:para>

                        <core:para>Section 94 of the IAA 1999 provides that an appeal is disposed of on the date when it is no longer pending for the purposes of the Immigration Acts. This was a reference to the definition of pending in s 58(5) of that Act. Section 58 of the IAA 1999 is repealed by this Act. Section 104 of this Act, which replaces it, gives a definition of ‘pending’ in relation to appeals under s 82(1) of that Act. While this will in time cover all the appeal rights that could be being exercised by applicants for asylum support, it requires some creative reading to read s 104 as the definition to which s 94(4) of the 1999 Act refers. There is also the danger of a hiatus following repeal of s 58 because this would mean that there was no definition of ‘pending’ applicable to those applicants for support who had appealed under the 1999 Act.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Under s 58 of the 1999 Act, judicial review of the adjudicator''s decision to refuse the appeal, or the IAT''s refusal of leave to appeal, did not fall within the definition of a pending appeal. However, under s 104(2) an appeal will be treated as pending while it is the subject of a statutory review under s 101(2) and, by operation of s 94(4) of the 1999 Act, will not have been ‘disposed of’ for support purposes.</core:para>
                        <core:para>The claim for asylum is, by virtue of the amendments, treated as determined only for the purposes of s 94(1) and not for Pt 6 as a whole.</core:para>
                        <core:para>New subs 4(3A) of the IAA 1999 largely re-enacts sub-ss 94(5) and (6), repealed by subs (5) herein. Matters not picked up in sub-s (3A) are covered by other amendments to s 94 effected by this section. Families with children under 18 continue to be eligible for NASS support until either the claim is successful, or they leave the country. Note that the position of such families in relation to community care legislation is altered by Sch 3 to that Act. Under that schedule, while children can continue to receive support under community care legislation, including s 17 of the Children Act 1989, while in the country and under 18, adults who are ‘failed asylum-seekers’ within the meaning of para 6 of that schedule, are not eligible for such support under such provisions. Support for the child of a ‘failed asylum seeker’ under, for example, s 17 of the Children Act 1989, cannot, under the terms of the Schedule, extend to the parents. See note to Sch 3.</core:para>

Detailed provision was made in the Asylum Support (Interim Provisions) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/3056).

                        <core:para>This section replaces s 122 of the IAA 1999. While it makes some changes to the section, the overall effect is to restate s 122 in clearer terms.</core:para>
                        <core:para>See note to s 44(4) of this Act, inserting a new s 94(3A) into the IAA 1999. This has the effect, previously achieved by s 94(5) of the IAA 1999, of ensuring that asylum-seeking families with children can continue to receive NASS support until the claim for asylum is successful or until they leave the country.</core:para>
                        <core:para>As with the old s 122, the new version ensures that there is a duty upon the Secretary of State to support families with children under 18. As with the previous version of s 122, the intention is that the family look first to the Secretary of State (NASS) for support, not to the duties of local authorities under the Children Acts.</core:para>
                        <core:para>A change from the old version of s 122(1) is that the duty to support a family kicks in when the family applies for support. However, while a local authority approached in the first instance, cannot point to an extant duty of the Secretary of State to support the family it can, under s 122(3)(c), refer the family to the Secretary of State for support. See note to s 17.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Under sub-s 122(2) the Secretary of State can offer the family accommodation in an accommodation centre, or in the NASS system outside the centres. The duty to provide support extends to the family as a whole, not just to the children.</core:para>
                        <core:para>The drafting of sub-s 122(3) goes some way to clearing up a confusion that existed under the old version of the section: what happens when a family does not immediately take up the Secretary of State''s offer of support? Subsection 122(3)(a) makes clear that a local authority is only prevented from supporting the family while the Secretary of State''s offer of support remains open in respect of that family. The previous version of the section did not deal with an offer of support remaining open and thus appeared to leave families in limbo if, for whatever reason, they did not at once accept the offer of support. Paragraph 127 of the Explanatory Notes to the Act envisages that were an offer of support withdrawn, sub-s 122(6) will apply in the same way as it would apply were support withdrawn.</core:para>
                        <core:para>The provision in sub-s 122(5) to disapply sub-s (3), re-enacts that found in the old sub-s 122(11).</core:para>
                        <core:para>Subsection 122(6) re-enacts the old sub-ss 122(8) and (9). The duty under the new sub-s 122(2) is to offer support, and, it would appear, as described above, to keep that offer open. This does not protect a supported family from losing their support, for example because they have breached the conditions under which support was provided (see s 50). Such a family is not free to apply to any local authority in the country, but must remain in the area where they were placed (and to which, for example, they were dispersed) by the Secretary of State.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Subsection 122(6) should be read with Sch 3 to this Act. See note to s 44(4). Where the adults in the family, subsequent to losing support from the Secretary of State, become ‘failed asylum seekers’ within the meaning of para 6 of that Schedule, the local authority loses its power to support them. See also note to Sch 3.</core:para>

Instead they continue to be supported by local authorities under the Children Acts. This section deals with central government funding in respect of such children and removes the need for a special report in respect of such payment, under the Local Government Finance Act 1988.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Section 110 of the IAA 1999 empowers the Secretary of State to pay local authorities where they have incurred, or will incur, expenditure in supporting adult asylum-seekers and any dependants. A grant regime also exists so that the Secretary of State can make payments to local authorities supporting unaccompanied children. Provision was made in 2001 for payments made under that regime to take account of the additional costs of supporting children under s 20 of the Children Act 1989, which tends to have greater cost implications than support under s 17 of that Act. Subsection 48(a) places the grant regime for unaccompanied children within the s 110 framework.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Section 111 of the IAA 1999 is less detailed than s 110 but the overall effect is to provide a similar power as is provided for payments to local authorities under s 110 in respect of payments to voluntary organisations. Subsection 48(b) allows similar grants to be made in respect of support provided to unaccompanied children. Note that there already exist schemes whereby the Secretary of State funds voluntary organisations to work with unaccompanied asylum-seeking children; the best known being the Home Office funding for the Refugee Council’s Unaccompanied Children’s Panel.</core:para>

The section did not cover all failed asylum seekers; the amendments effected by this section ensure that it now does. Thus, for example, a person who applied for asylum while they had extant leave to enter or remain in the UK, and was neither on temporary admission nor a former detainee, would not have qualified for support under the old s 4, but does qualify for support under s 4 as amended by this section.</core:para>
                        <core:para>This section must be read with Sch 3, whereby powers to accommodate certain groups who would otherwise be eligible for s 4 support are curtailed, notably in respect of failed asylum-seekers and persons unlawfully in the UK who have failed to cooperate with removal directions.

See also s 71, which allows residence restrictions to be imposed on those who applied for asylum while they had extant leave. Such people could be required to reside in s 4 accommodation.</core:para>

                        <core:para>As far as the asylum-seeker is concerned, this section might be better entitled ‘No choice of form of support’, for the effect is to arrogate the choice of the form of support to be provided to the Secretary of State.</core:para>
                        <core:para>See s 53 on rights of appeal, inserting new ss 103, 103A and 103B into the IAA 1999. New s 103(4) makes clear that there is no right of appeal against a withdrawal of support under either s 17 of this Act or s 95 of the IAA 1999 where support is replaced immediately by support under the other provision. It would appear that the effect of this section, read with the oddly worded s 103(2), is that rights of appeal are similarly curtailed where the application is for support under one of these two sections; this is refused, and support is offered under the other section. But see note to s 17 for the likelihood that a single application will cover support under both sections. The more difficult question is the effect of an offer of support under s 4 of the IAA 1999. Nothing in s 103 of the IAA 1999 as amended suggests that support under s 4 ousts the right of appeal to an adjudicator against a refusal of support.</core:para>

                        <core:para>This section replaces s 103 of the IAA 1999 with new ss 103, 103A and 103B. The majority of the provisions are unchanged, or amended only insofar as is necessary to make reference to the new power to support asylum seekers, in accommodation centres, contained in s 17 of this Act.

                           <core:para>The IAA 1999 made provision for detainee custody officers, certified persons empowered to exercise certain detention and escort functions. Detainee custody officers have the power to search a detained person. Thus the word ‘search’ in the new sub-para 17(4) of Sch 2 to the IA 1971 refers to the search of a detained person, not of premises or other people on the premises. It is broad enough to authorise strip searches. The detainee custody officer can only enter the premises where an immigration or police officer holding a search warrant makes such an entry. Ministers emphasised during the passage of the Act that detainee custody officers would always be accompanied on the premises by immigration or police officers (see for example <core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> Standing Committee E, 14 May 2002, Col 242, Rosie Winterton MP, Parliamentary Secretary, LCD). It is therefore unclear in what circumstances detainee custody officers themselves will be using the power given them by the new sub-para 17(4) inserted by this section power to enter premises, if necessary by reasonable force.</core:para>
                           <core:para>The detainee custody officer is the only person with power to strip search a person on the premises. Immigration and police officers, who, unlike detainee custody officers, have to act in accordance with the PACE (Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984) Codes of Practice, would have to take the person to a police station or other authorised location to conduct such a search.

                           <core:para>The clause that became this section was originally introduced into parliament without subs (1)(a) and under the title ‘Liability to detention: interpretation’. There was widespread concern that it massively extended existing powers to detain. The wording was changed to reflect what Ministers stated to be the intention behind the clause: to ensure that the Home Office had power to grant temporary admission in cases where removal could not be effected. Mr Justice Crane held in <core:emph typestyle="it">R (on the application of Huez) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">

                              </lnci:cite> that because in such circumstances removal was not ‘pending’ within the meaning of the s 4(2) and paras 8, 16 and 21 of the IA 1971, there was no power to detain and therefore no power to grant temporary admission. One consequence was that there was no power to make people in this position subject to the conditions, such as restrictions on employment or reporting obligations, that can be attached to temporary admission. Huez and Khadir were Iraqi Kurds. It had been held that they did not qualify for refugee status because they could live in safety in the Kurdish Autonomous Area of Iraq, but there was no means of getting them there. Mr Justice Crane held that in the circumstances, consideration should be given to a grant of Exceptional Leave to Remain. But this was reversed by the Court of Appeal in <core:emph typestyle="it">R (on the application of Khadir) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">
                                 <lnci:content>[2003] EWCA Civ 475</lnci:content>
                              </lnci:cite>, holding that Mr Khadir was indeed to be regarded as being on temporary admission, and that it was not appropriate to grant Exceptional Leave.</core:para>
                           <core:para>The effect of the clause as amended is to ensure that those in the position of Huez and Khadir can be granted temporary admission. Conditions and restrictions can be imposed upon such admission. The conceptual difficulty arises where the person breaches those conditions or restrictions: if the rationale for this section is that such persons cannot be detained then breach of conditions or restrictions cannot be backed by the threat of detention, save insofar as this is consequential upon ‘criminal liability’, following conviction for an offence, see note to sub-s (3)).</core:para>
                           <core:para>
                              <core:emph typestyle="it">(2)(a)</core:emph>) The description of one legal obligation, for the examples given during the debates included art 3 of the ECHR, incorporated into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998, as a ‘legal impediment’ to the exercise of another, is a surprising departure.</core:para>
                           <core:para>
                              <core:emph typestyle="it">(3)</core:emph> Ministers stated that the government intended that the retrospective effect of the provision would not operate to create criminal liability under s 24(1)(e) of the IA 1971 for a breach of restrictions on temporary admission imposed under para 21 of Sch 2, or para 2(5) of Sch 3 to the IA 1971, retrospectively made legal by the coming into force of this section. They stated: ‘Criminal liability would however, arise if a person whose restrictions had been validated by this clause failed to comply with such restrictions without a reasonable excuse after the clause comes into force’ (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> HL Report, 10 October 2002, Vol 639, No 184, Cols 457–458, Lord Filkin, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department). However, the House of Lords Select Committee on the Constitution said of the clause ‘9. …although it was not intended to impose criminal liability retrospectively its plain words make it obvious that it could well have that effect’ (7th Report of the Session 2001–2002, HL Paper 173, 22 October 2002). No further elucidation of the term ‘criminal liability’ was given; if it means liability for detention consequent upon breach of the restriction, then this appears wholly at variance with the assurances given by the government, that the section would in no way extend their power to detain (see above). The discussion centred on criminal liability, but the government would of course rely on this section if faced with civil damages claims from persons detained in the same circumstances as Huez and Khadir prior to the coming into force of this section.</core:para>

                           <core:para>This section may be read as another example of the closer links being forged between the support and control processes. The IAA 1999 was operated so that asylum-seekers who applied for support went first to temporary or emergency accommodation (see s 98 of the IAA 1999) and then into accommodation under the support scheme established by Pt 6 of that Act. The time in emergency accommodation was spent waiting for the decision on the application for support, and was not integrated into the asylum process. Under this section, provision is made for an initial stage, which may involve residing in a particular location, following the application for asylum. Ministers spoke during the debate of ‘induction centres’ from which asylum seekers would go to accommodation centres established under Pt 2 of this Act, or to accommodation provided by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) under Pt 6 of the IAA 1999, as amended by Pt 3 of this Act; although such centres would not necessarily be residential. There is no requirement however that induction take place immediately after the claim for asylum is made, and a residence restriction for the purposes of induction could be imposed upon people who had made their asylum claim some time before.</core:para>
                           <core:para>Asylum seekers who are not in receipt of support can be made to go through the programme of induction. See s 55(11).</core:para>

By removing that part of the definition, this section makes it possible for residence restrictions for the purposes of induction to be imposed upon unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. Ministers stated that unaccompanied minors should go through an induction process, but that this should be a separate process from that provided for adults (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph>, Standing Committee E, 14 May 2002, Col 263, Angela Eagle MP, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department). The Lord Filkin, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office wrote to the charity Save the Children on 10 September 2002 stating ‘Unaccompanied Asylum-Seeking Children (‘UASC’) are specifically excluded from induction centres’ but this exclusion does not appear on the face of the statute.</core:para>

                           <core:para>This section largely re-enacts s 15 of the IAA 1999 (repealed by sub-s (5)), albeit with changes to the drafting. The change of substance is the express provision for the taking of ‘any other interim or preparatory action’ (see sub-s (4)(c)), ie action apart from the giving of removal directions or making of a deportation order, before the claim for asylum has been determined. Examples of such action given during debates included the completion of ‘a routine travel document application’ (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> HL Report, 17 July 2002, Vol 637, No 172, Col 1339, Lord Bassam of Brighton). This is a major departure from the rationale stated by Ministers at the time of the passage of the 1999 Act to underlie s 15 of that Act. The Lord Williams of Mostyn for the government said of that section ‘what we want is a sensible opportunity to provide both documents [a decision on the asylum claim and a deportation order] in the same envelope’ (<core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> HL Report Vol 605, No 136, Col 785). See also s 78 of this Act.</core:para>

However, the government indicated during debates that s 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provided the level of protection necessary in such cases (see <core:emph typestyle="it">Hansard</core:emph> Standing Committee E, 14 May 2002, Col 275, Rosie Winterton MP, Parliamentary Secretary LCD).</core:para>

                           <core:para>See note to s 77. Section 15 of the IAA 1999 made no provision for the period between refusal by the Secretary of State and the final determination of any appeal. Paragraph 10 of Sch 4 to the IAA 1999 made provision for a stay on removal directions while an appeal was pending. Provision is made in Sch 9 of this Act for the repeal of Sch 4 of the IAA 1999. This new section means that, subject to s 79 (see note to that section) all the steps that can be taken while an application for asylum is pending before the Secretary of State (see s 77) can also be taken subsequent to the Secretary of State''s refusal and while an appeal is pending, as defined in s 104 (see note thereto). The vulnerability of the person concerned to rapid removal or deportation as soon as the appeal is finally determined is thereby increased.</core:para>

                                       <core:para>Provision is made to repeal the whole of Pt 4 and Sch 2 to 4 of the IAA 1999. But see the somewhat confusing reference to repeal in Sch 9. There provision is made for the repeal of Sch 4 as a whole, but also for repeal of the provisions for manifestly unfounded claims contained in para 9 of the Schedule. There is no corresponding power of partial repeal in this section, but it might be possible to use Sch 9 of this Act to repeal the relevant sub-paragraphs of the 1999 Act before repealing the Schedule as a whole. While Sch 4 of the IAA 1999 remains in force, provision is made to amend it by para 29 of Sch 7 of this Act. See notes to Schs 6 and 7.</core:para>
                                       <core:para>The effect of the repeal of Pt 4 of the IAA 1999 and of Sch 4 of that Act is that the accelerated procedure for which provision is made in para 9 of Sch 4 to that Act will be abolished and that cases there will no longer be powers to certify claims on the basis that the appellant did not possess a valid passport etc. The only certification procedures for which provision is made in this Act have to do with removing rights of appeal rather than subjecting appeals to an accelerated procedure. There is no provision in this Act for a truncated appeals procedure—all cases that go to the adjudicator are cases where an application can be made for leave to appeal to the IAT with a right of statutory review under s 101(2).</core:para>

                           <core:para>The new s 3C of the IA 1971 makes few changes from the old. Where a person make an application to vary their leave while they still have extant leave, but the extant leave expires before the variation application is decided the extant leave shall be deemed to continue until the application is decided. A new provision is the express requirement that the person remain in the UK (see s 3C(3)) until the application is decided. The new s 3C makes provision for circumstances in which an application is withdrawn and where there is no appeal against the decision.</core:para>

Prior to amendment by this section, para 6(3) of Sch 2 to the IA 1971 provided that if a notice refusing leave to enter under that section were cancelled, then if at the time of cancellation the person was not given indefinite or limited leave to enter s/he would be deemed to have been given six months leave to enter, no employment permitted. The effect of this section is that the immigration officer can now require the person to submit to further examination. If this is done, no six-month leave is deemed to have been given.</core:para>

The powers cannot be used to locate those who have failed to report to a medical officer under s 24(1)(d) of the Act, nor for the location of persons specified in orders in council made under s 3(7) of that Act (see s 24(1)(g) of that Act).

                           <core:para>This section would allow the Secretary of State to provide by order, subject to the affirmative procedure in parliament (see sub-s (5)) for UK immigration and other controls to operate at EEA ports outside the UK. The order must be made to give effect to an international agreement which ‘concerns’ immigration control (see sub-s (1)), but neither the agreement nor the provisions of the order need be related to immigration control. The section appears to envisage that the person at the overseas control could be subject to UK law, but provides for that law to be disapplied (see sub-ss (3)(a) to (e)). The Explanatory Notes to the Acts state, at para 346, that an order made under sub-s (3) ‘may specify that particular laws of England and Wales have effect (with or without modification) in that part of the EEA where immigration and other frontier controls are being carried out by UK officials. An order may also modify or even disapply UK legislation in order to allow officers form other countries to carry out their functions on UK territory’.</core:para>
                           <core:para>The powers are broad and general. They include (see sub-s (3)(j)) powers of detention and removal. See s 80, inserting a new s 11 into the IAA 1999. ‘Standing arrangements’ under the new s 11, which can include bilateral agreements between member States, could be used to pass those stopped at the controls envisaged by this section to the authorities of the State in which the controls were based. Thus for example, a person stopped at these controls could be identified as a person whose asylum claim should be made in a third country, for example the country in which the control was based, and the person could be handed over to the authorities of that country under a bilateral agreement.</core:para>

Section 28B of the Immigration Act 1971 provides a power to enter premises, with a warrant, search for and arrest a person for the s 24(1)(d) offence. This new subsection complements that power with a free-standing power of arrest. Under new s 28AA(1)(b), for the first time, the employment offence under s 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 carries a specific power of arrest. Prior to the enactment of this section, it was necessary to rely on the general powers of arrest contained in the PACE 1984. These did not extend to immigration officers. Immigration officers are given their own power of arrest, with warrant.</core:para>

                           <core:para>The powers of entry and search without warrant in new s 28FA relate specifically to employee or personnel records. New sub-s 28FA(1)(c) and (d) mean that no arrest need have been made for the powers in this new section to be triggered.</core:para>
                           <core:para>New s 28FA(2) requires that the arrest under s 24(1) or 24A(1) of the IA 1971 has been made on the business premises, or that the person liable to arrest is on the premises for the power to be triggered. This is not a freestanding power to search business premises.</core:para>
                           <core:para>The trigger for the search is the reasonable belief that an offence under s 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 has been committed in relation to the person arrested or liable to arrest (sub-s (2)). However, the power of seizure of documents under sub-s (3) extends to documents that may assist in prove a fraud offence in relation to asylum support. Moreover, nothing in subs (3), with its reference to ‘an’ offence, prevents the seizure and retention of documents relating to offences other than offences by the person whose arrest or liability to arrest triggered the search.</core:para>
                           <core:para>New s 28FB is a power of search of business premises with a warrant where an immigration officer convinces a justice of the peace that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an employer has failed to comply with s 134 and it is not practicable to obtain employee records in any other way. The records must contain, or lead to the obtaining of, the information required by s 134. There is no requirement for any prior arrest under this section. Subsection (4) imports a power to read the reference to a justice of the peace as a reference to a sheriff where appropriate. Once again, having gained entry, the power of search can be used for wider purposes, namely to obtain evidence of fraud of the asylum support system (see new subs (5)(b)).</core:para>

Section of the IA 1971 provides for an extended time limit: up to three years from the date of commission of the offence, provided that proceedings are brought within two months of the date certified as the date on which there was evidence sufficient to bring proceedings. There is no time limit on indictable offences. Since the offences in both ss 24A and 25 (replaced under s 143 of this Act by new ss 25 to 25C) can be tried either way, there is no need to use the provisions of s 28 to extend time, and therefore they are removed from s 28 by this section.</core:para>

                        <core:para>Unlike s 170 of the IAA 1999, this section makes no express provision for its own coming into force. However, the wording ‘the preceding sections’ in sub-s (1) appears to indicate that ss 162 to 164 came into force on Royal Assent. The ambit of this section extends beyond commencement because orders under sub-s (1) may, by sub-s (6) make provision for transitional provision. There is also provision in sub-s (6) to commence a section for a specified purpose or in relation to, for example, a specific geographical area. Nothing on the face of this section bars that partial commencement being used, for example, for the offences provisions of Pt 7.</core:para>
                        <core:para>This Act amends provisions of the IAA 1999 which were not in force at the time of Royal Assent of this Act. Therefore it is important to make reference to commencement orders under the 1999 Act, bringing provisions amended by this Act into force. See the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Commencement No 11) Order 2002 (SI 2002/2816) and the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Commencement No 12) Order 2003 (SI 2003/2). The following commencement orders have been made under this section:</core:para>
                        <core:para>The Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 1) Order 2002 (SI 2002/2811)) and the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No 3) Order 2003 (SI 1/2003). Both orders include transitional provisions.</core:para>

                     <core:para>The intention is to confer British Citizenship at a public ceremony, to be conducted by a registrar.

                     <core:para>The provisions of the Schedule will apply both to those who obtain their British citizenship by registration and those who obtain it by naturalisation, but note that under the new s 42 of the BNA 1981 (inserted by para 1 of this Schedule) the making of the oath and pledge at a citizenship ceremony is only made a requirement for adults. There is however no express bar in the Schedule to a child obtaining British Citizenship participating in a ceremony, although there may be issues over competence to take the oath and make the pledge.</core:para>
                     <core:para>Nothing in this Act or in the BNA 1981 as amended would prevent the new ceremonies being introduced prior to the coming into force of s 1 of this Act (new test of sufficient knowledge of life in the United Kingdom).</core:para>

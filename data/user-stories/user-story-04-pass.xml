                     <core:para>These Regulations are intended to implement the Personal Protective Equipment Directive 89/656: see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.1042]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>. They also take account of the Approximation of Personal Protection Equipment Laws Directive 89/686 as amended which is implemented in the UK by the Personal Protective Equipment Regulations 2002, SI 2002/1144: see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.817]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>. But the Regulations do not require the user of temporary workers to provide them with personal protective equipment and so appear to fail to implement the Temporary Workers Directive 91/383 in this regard.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations were introduced under HSWA 1974, s 15 and consequently provisions of that Act are relevant to the interpretation of the Regulations. A breach of the Regulations gives rise to a potential criminal and civil liability: see HSWA 1974, ss 33(1) and 47(2).</core:para>
                     <core:para>These Regulations are not supplemented by an Approved Code of Practice but there is an extensive HSE Guidance Note called ‘Personal Protective Equipment at Work’ (L25, 2nd edition, 2005, not reproduced in this work) which has no statutory admissibility in civil or criminal proceedings, though a court might consider its recommendations relevant.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations apply to all employment except sea-going ships. The duties are imposed even where compliance involves political decisions concerning military procurement or deployment of resources: <core:emph typestyle="it">Smith v Ministry of Defence</core:emph> 
                        <lnci:cite type="case">

                        </lnci:cite>. The Regulations define ‘personal protective equipment’ very broadly excluding, in essence, only ordinary working clothes, uniforms, road vehicle safety equipment (seat belts, crash helmets etc), and sports equipment (reg 2(1)). The duty is on employers (and the self-employed) to provide suitable personal protective equipment (PPE) to employees who may be exposed to risk except to the extent that the risk has been controlled by other effective means (reg 4(1)). The employer must carry out an assessment of the risks not avoided by other means, defining the characteristics needed from any PPE, and comparing the PPE available with those characteristics (reg 6). The assessment must be kept under review. The PPE provided must be appropriate and adequate, fit the wearer, take account of ergonomic design and the state of health of the wearer, comply with the EEC standards in Directive 89/686 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.1042]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>) implemented by the relevant Regulations and Directive 93/42 (on medical devices), be compatible and effective where worn with other protective equipment used against other risks and be kept in efficient working order and in good repair (regs 4(3) and 7). Employees must be given adequate instruction and training and they must use the equipment and report any loss or damage (reg 9). Employers must take reasonable steps to ensure the equipment is properly used (reg 10).</core:para>
                     <core:para>To the extent that the Regulations fail to give effect to the Directives they are intended to implement, the corresponding provisions of the Directives are relevant as an aid to interpretation; and against an emanation of the state a claimant may be able to rely directly on the provisions of the Directives (see ‘Interpretation in the light of the European Directives’ at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.9]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite> and ‘Direct application of the European Directives’ at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.40]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). One possible shortfall is the absence in the Regulations of a duty to ensure that equipment used by more than one person does not create health or hygiene problems (Art 4.4). Another apparent deficiency concerns the Temporary Workers Directive 91/383 at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1429]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>. The Regulations only apply as between employer and employee (and to the self-employed). Unless agency workers are held to be employees of the undertaking that uses their services, they can only look to their employing agency, and not to the user of their services, for the provision of PPE. This appears to be a failure to implement Article 2(1) and 2(2) of the Temporary Workers Directive. The Personal Protective Equipment Directive imposes a duty on the employer to consult with workers and/or their representatives (see Article 8). No equivalent duty is contained in the Regulations, but the employer's general duties to consult union safety representatives or worker representatives are probably sufficiently wide to include the matters covered by the Regulations (see HSWA 1974, s 2(6); Safety Representative and Safety Committees Regulations 1977, reg 4A and Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996, reg 3).</core:para>

                     <core:para>The Regulations came into force on 1 January 1993 (reg 1). There is no exception for PPE already in use before that date (cf the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998).</core:para>

                        <core:para>This regulation imposes upon the employer a duty to provide employees with personal protective equipment (PPE) to guard against risks to their health and safety which have not been adequately controlled by other means. In so far as the duty does not include workers who are employed by an agency, even though assigned to work for another employer, this may be inadequate implementation of the Temporary Workers Directive (see general note to the Regulations). PPE is a ‘last resort’, see reg 4 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and paras 20–22 of the Guidance Note to these Regulations. According to Article 3 of the PPE Directive 89/656, PPE should only be provided where the risks ‘cannot’ be avoided by other means.

                        <core:para>Where there is a risk of injury which is not adequately controlled by other means, the duty is to make an assessment (under reg 6) of what PPE is suitable and then to ensure (under reg 4(1)) that such PPE is provided: <core:emph typestyle="it">Henser-Leather v Securicor Cash Services Ltd</core:emph>

Where the complaint is that PPE has been provided but it is not suitable, then counsel would be well advised to plead a failure to provide suitable PPE ‘contrary to regulations 4 and 6’: <core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall</core:emph> para [9]. The primary obligation is that in reg 4(1), to ensure that suitable PPE is provided. Regulation 4(3) makes it clear that equipment will not be suitable if it does not meet certain specific criteria, but failure to meet those criteria does not relieve the employer of the obligation imposed by reg 4(1): <core:emph typestyle="it">Henser-Leather</core:emph> para [28].</core:para>
                        <core:para>The duty is different to that at common law. It is strict. PPE, if required, must be suitable.

                        <core:para>The meaning of suitability is guided by reg 4(3), and is thus different from other Regulations with different or no guidance eg in reg 12 of the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992: <core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall v Hull City Council</core:emph> para [34]. To be suitable, the PPE must be appropriate for the relevant risks and the conditions under which it is used (reg 4(3)(a)); it must take account of the user’s health, ergonomic requirements and his workstation (reg 4(3)(b)); it must fit the user (reg 4(3)(c)); it must be effective in dealing with the risks without increasing the overall risk (reg 4(3)(d)); it must comply with legislation implementing PPE Directive 89/686 (reg 4(3) (e)). Finally, as the foregoing specific requirements are without prejudice to a more general requirement of suitability (reg 4(1)), the PPE must also satisfy that more general requirement. If the PPE fails to meet any of these requirements, it is not suitable. The duty to provide suitable PPE is not relieved where to do so would be disproportionate to the risk (<core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall</core:emph> at [12] and [44]) or otherwise not sensible (<core:emph typestyle="it">Blair v Chief Constable of Sussex Police</core:emph>

It is first necessary to identify the risk of injury, and then to ask if the equipment in fact provided was, so far as practicable, effective to prevent or adequately control that risk. It is only if the equipment was effective or it was not practicable to make it effective that there is any need to consider whether the equipment is appropriate within regulation 4(3)(a) or take account of ergonomic requirements or the claimant’s state of health within regulation 4(3)(b)': <core:emph typestyle="it">Blair</core:emph> at [6].</core:para>

                        <core:para>Regulation 6 requires an employer to give specific consideration to the risks against which it is intended to provide PPE and to assess whether that PPE is suitable. It is a free standing obligation, breach of which will not be directly causative of injury but will be likely to lead to a breach of the duty (under reg 4) to provide suitable PPE, see eg <core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall v Hull City Council</core:emph>

A risk assessment that fails to identify a particular risk which the court identifies and which fails to consider what PPE should be provided to meet that risk is defective: <core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall</core:emph>. Regulation 6 should be considered alongside reg 4. In a damages claim arising out of injury sustained due to inadequate PPE, the pleading should allege failure to provide suitable PPE ‘contrary to regulations 4 and 6’ but the court should still consider reg 6 even if it has not been pleaded: <core:emph typestyle="it">Threlfall v Hull City Council</core:emph>, para [9].</core:para>

Therefore steel toe-capped boots provided to protect against the risk of crush injury remained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair even though they had a minute hole that allowed in freezing water that caused the wearer to suffer frostbite. The risk of such an injury was not foreseeable whereas crush injury was and the boots remained able to protect against crush injury. (Note that if there had been a weather risk against which the boots should have protected, the result would have been different: see Lord Hoffmann at paragraph 15.)</core:para>

                        <core:para>Article 4(9) of the Directive states that the equipment ‘must be used in accordance with instructions’. The duty under reg 10 is likely to be at least as high as that owed in negligence: see eg <core:emph typestyle="it">Bux v Slough Metals Ltd</core:emph> 
                           <lnci:cite type="case">
                              <lnci:content>[1974] 1 All ER 262, CA</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>. Under reg 10(2) the employee is under a duty to use the PPE provided, so that the law is likely to remain unchanged that an employee not provided with protective equipment may fail in an action if it is shown that he would not have used it anyway (<core:emph typestyle="it">Nolan v Dental Manufacturing Co Ltd</core:emph> 
                           <lnci:cite type="case">

                           </lnci:cite>). The burden of proving this will probably fall on the employer. It is a heavy burden to discharge. It requires not simply showing that the employee would not have used the equipment if it had been provided, but that the employee would not have used it even if the employer had taken ‘all reasonable steps to ensure’ that he use it: <core:emph typestyle="it">Henser-Leather v Securicor Cash Services Ltd</core:emph> 
                           <lnci:cite type="case">

                           </lnci:cite>. The combination of the employer's duty to provide suitable PPE (reg 4(1)), to inform the employee what it is for and how to use it (reg 9(1)), to take steps to ensure the employee does use it properly (reg 10(1)) and the employee's duty to do so (reg 10(2)) make it difficult for an employer to argue that the employee would not have used suitable PPE if it had been provided.</core:para>

                     <core:para>These Regulations (PUWER 1998) revoke and replace PUWER 1992 (SI 1992/2932) (see the 3rd edition of this work). PUWER 1992 came into force on 1 January 1993 and were intended to implement the first Work Equipment Directive 89/655/EEC. The 1989 Directive was supplemented by an amending Directive 95/63/EC which was implemented by, amongst others, PUWER 1998 and the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, SI 1998/2307. PUWER 1998 not only revoked and replaced the 1992 Regulations, but also various other, older sets of Regulations concerned with specific types of equipment (see reg 39 and Sch 4 for a list of revocations) and it also repealed s 19 of the Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963 (see reg 38). The 1989 and 1995 Directives have now been replaced by the second Work Equipment Directive 2009/104/EC (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.1058]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>).</core:para>
                     <core:para>Both PUWER 1992 and PUWER 1998 were made under HSWA 1974, s 15 and consequently provisions of that Act, as well as the Directives, are relevant to the interpretation of the Regulations. A breach of the Regulations gives rise to a potential criminal and civil liability: see HSWA 1974, ss 33(1) and 47(2). Wider than the 1992 Regulations, the 1998 Regulations contain a slightly different definition of work equipment and also place duties on those who have control over work equipment. These Regulations, unlike the original 1992 Regulations, also contain provisions dealing specifically with mobile work equipment (regs 25–30) and power presses (regs 31–35).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The approach of the Regulations is to impose general duties relating to all equipment rather than the traditional approach of specific obligations relevant only to particular kinds of equipment. Thus ‘work equipment’ is widely defined as ‘any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work’ and ‘use’ covers a wide range of activities concerning that equipment (see reg 2). In the light of being new legislation, derived from the Directive, authorities on earlier and differently worded provisions of eg the Factories Act 1961 are of limited relevance (as indicated in <core:emph typestyle="it">English v North Lanarkshire Council</core:emph> 
                        <lnci:cite type="case">
                           <lnci:content>1999 SCLR 310 (OH)</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). Therefore, when construing the regulations, it is necessary to have regard to the provisions of the Framework Directive and the Work Equipment Directive: <core:emph typestyle="it">Robb v Salamis (M &amp; I) Ltd</core:emph> 
                        <lnci:cite type="case">

                        </lnci:cite>, per Lord Hope of Craighead. However, authorities on identically worded provisions of earlier legislation are still followed, see eg <core:emph typestyle="it">Stark v Post Office</core:emph> 
                        <lnci:cite type="case">

                     <core:para>The Regulations do not impose a duty to provide work equipment, rather they impose duties regarding such work equipment as is provided. These duties are to ensure work equipment is and remains suitable and conforms to standards specified in other legislation implementing European Directives (listed in Sch 1); to restrict, to designated employees only, use of equipment likely to present specific risks to health and safety; to provide adequate information, instructions and training; to protect against dangerous parts and other specified hazards; to protect against high or very low temperatures; to provide visible controls to start, control, stop and emergency stop the equipment; to provide safe control systems; to provide isolation from energy sources; to stabilise equipment; to light it; to protect against risks while maintaining it; and to include safety markings and warning devices on work equipment. Part III of the Regulations imposes duties specific to mobile work equipment, including fork lift trucks. Part IV applies to power presses.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The duties imposed under these Regulations are imposed even where compliance involves political decisions concerning military procurement or deployment of resources: <core:emph typestyle="it">Smith v Ministry of Defence</core:emph>

                        </lnci:cite>.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations are accompanied by ACOP material and HSE guidance entitled <core:emph typestyle="it">Safe Use of Work Equipment</core:emph> (L22) (3rd edn, 2008, ISBN 9780717662951). This guidance does not cover power presses and woodworking machinery, which, although both subject to PUWER, each have their own guidance and ACOP material: <core:emph typestyle="it">Safe use of power presses</core:emph> (L112) (1998, ISBN 97807176162753) and <core:emph typestyle="it">Safe use of woodworking machinery</core:emph> (L114) (1998, ISBN 9780717616305). Unlike the ACOP material, the guidance has no statutory admissibility in legal proceedings, but is often considered relevant by the courts.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations impose duties not only upon employers (but not in all circumstances, see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.636]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>) but also upon the self-employed and, importantly, to a person who has control to any extent of work equipment, of how it is used at work or of those who use it or supervise its use, to the extent of that control (reg 3(3)). Extending duties beyond the traditional focus on the employer-employee relationship, this regulation probably gives effect to the Temporary Workers' Directive: para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1429]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>.</core:para>
                     <core:para>Work equipment relating to ships, whether used on or off the ship, is generally excluded from the Regulations (see reg 3(6)–(10)). They may however be subject to the Merchant Shipping and Fishing Vessels (Provision and Use of Work Equipment) Regulations 2006, SI 2006/2183.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations impose a liability upon a wider class of persons than required by the Directive. The Directive relates to employers, whereas the Regulations also relate to the self-employed and to others who control or supervise work equipment or its use: see reg 3(3). To the extent that the Regulations fail to give effect to the Directives they are intended to implement, the corresponding provisions of the Directives are relevant as an aid to interpretation; and against an emanation of the state a claimant may be able to rely directly on the provisions of the Directives (see ‘Interpretation in the light of the European Directives’ at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.9]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite> and ‘Direct application of the European Directives’ at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.40]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite> in Part 2A general principles). Some areas of possible defective implementation are the following. Para 2.8 of the Annex to the Equipment Directive imposes a requirement to provide guards or devices to prevent access to danger ‘where there is a risk of mechanical contact with moving parts … which could lead to accidents’. This seems to equate to the absolute standard previously imposed by Factories Act 1961, s 14 and Offices, Shops and Railway Premises Act 1963, s 17. However, the duty imposed by reg 11 to prevent access to dangerous parts of machinery is limited to what is ‘practicable’ and therefore (at least in factories or offices and railway premises) is less strict than was imposed by the previous legislation. It is arguable that diminution of an existing standard is inconsistent with the purpose of the Directives: see ‘Direct application of the European Directives’ at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.40]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>. This apparent deficiency has not been overcome by the amendments to reg 11 introduced by the Health and Safety (Miscellaneous) Amendment Regulations 2002, SI 2002/2174. Another possible deficiency is that regs 5 and 10 may not fully implement Article 4(2). Also, Article 8 requires employers to consult workers and/or their representatives. No such duty is imposed by the Regulations. However, the similar duties imposed under HSWA 1974, s 2(6), Safety Representative and Safety Committees Regulations 1977, reg 4A, and Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996, reg 3 probably suffice In <core:emph typestyle="it">Robb v Salamis (M &amp; I) Ltd</core:emph>

                           <core:para>This definition of work equipment in reg 2(1) differs from that in the previous PUWER 1992 in two respects. First, in PUWER 1992 the definition included ‘any assembly of components which, in order to achieve a common end, function as a whole’. This has now been replaced by ‘installation’ (which is included in Article 2 of the Directive). Second, the requirement that the equipment be ‘for use’ at work has been added (<core:emph typestyle="it">cf</core:emph> the Directive which defines work equipment as equipment ‘used’ at work).</core:para>

Whether something is work equipment depends upon what is its purpose, what it is for: <core:emph typestyle="it">Spencer-Franks</core:emph>, per Lord Hoffmann at para 10. If equipment is for use at work, then it is still work equipment even when it is not in fact being used. Although ‘work equipment’ is equipment ‘for use at work’, and ‘use’ is any activity involving ‘work equipment’, there is no circularity in the definition: <core:emph typestyle="it">Smith v Northamptonshire County Council</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">

                              </lnci:cite>, per Waller LJ at para 21. This is because the definition of ‘use’ in reg 2(1) applies ‘unless the context requires otherwise’ and the context in the definition of ‘work equipment’, also in reg 2(1), does indeed require otherwise: <core:emph typestyle="it">Spencer-Franks v Kellogg Brown and Root Ltd</core:emph>, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 50. Consequently, ‘use’, as it appears within the definition of ‘work equipment’, does not include ‘repair’; whereas ‘use’, as it appears elsewhere within the Regulations, does include ‘repair’. Something does not become work equipment simply because someone at work repairs it. But if it is work equipment, then to repair it is to use it.</core:para>
                           <core:para>There are two types of equipment. The first is equipment for use at work and the second is equipment which is not for use at work. Of the former, there are two sub-sets: the first is work equipment to which (by reg 3) these Regulations apply; the second is that to which they do not. ‘You first decide whether some apparatus is work equipment or not and then you decide whether the regulations apply to it’: per Lord Hoffmann in <core:emph typestyle="it">Spencer-Franks</core:emph> at para 19.

                              </lnci:cite> it was held that the meaning of ‘at work’ was not co-extensive with ‘course of employment’ as per HSWA 1974, s.52(1) but the meaning had to have regard to Article 3(1) of the Directive which requires that employers ensure the suitability of work equipment ‘made available to workers in the undertaking and/or establishment’. Pill LJ said (at para 22): ‘Whether the employee is acting in the course of his employment is, in my view, certainly an important factor to be considered in deciding whether he is using equipment ‘at work’ at the material time. However, the expression ‘at work’, as used in the context of the Directive, with its reference to ‘undertaking’ and ‘establishment’, may import a spatial or geographical limitation upon the places at which, and hence upon the equipment to which, the duty attaches. The degree of control exercised over the equipment by the employer may also be a factor in deciding whether the equipment is being used at work within the meaning of the Regulations'. Therefore a receptionist using a lift in a multi-occupational office building to go home from her employer's offices on an upper floor was using the lift ‘at work’.

                           <core:para>The definition of ‘use’ in reg 2(1) applies ‘unless the context requires otherwise’. In the definition of ‘work equipment’, the context does indeed require otherwise: <core:emph typestyle="it">Spencer-Franks v Kellogg Brown &amp; Root Ltd</core:emph>

The definition of ‘use’ includes ‘repair’, whereas in the definition of ‘work equipment’, ‘use’ does not include ‘repair’. Therefore, although ‘repair’ is a method of ‘use’ of work equipment, it is not an activity which of itself renders something as work equipment. If something is an item of work equipment, then to repair it is to use it, but before the repairing of an item can be the use of work equipment, the item must already be work equipment.

                           <core:para>The class of persons upon whom duties are imposed by the 1998 Regulations is wider than under the 1992 Regulations. In addition to the employer of a worker who uses or is provided with work equipment, and to a self-employed person who uses work equipment at work, duties are now also placed upon ‘any person’ who, in the course of a business, trade or other undertaking, has control to any extent of the equipment, of those who use it or of the way it is used (cf reg 4(2)(b) of the 1992 Regulations). The imposition of duties on a person other than an employer goes beyond the minimum requirements of the Equipment Directive.</core:para>
                           <core:para>Although reg 3 imposes duties not only in respect of work equipment provided for use but also in respect of work equipment that is in fact used, this still only applies to work equipment as defined in reg 2(1); namely, equipment ‘for use at work’: see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">

                           <core:para>The existence and extent of a non-employer's duty relates to the extent of his control. Regulation 3(3)(b) sets out three different methods of control. As the duties imposed are limited by the extent of control, it follows that the method of control dictates which duties are imposed. Regulation 3(3)(b)(i) applies only to control of the item's physical state and is limited to the extent of the factual control. It does not extend to control of the worker who uses it or supervises or manages its use, nor to the way in which it is used at work. These are covered by reg 3(3)(b)(ii) and 3(3)(b)(iii). In order to ascertain which type(s) of control the non-employer has, one should consider the facts of his control and the purpose for which he has it. This will enable the court to see which of the regulations apply. ‘… it is in my judgment permissible to read words into regulation 3(3)(b) to enable a construction to be given which will make sense to those in the trade or business or other undertaking (the class covered by 3(4)) and still give sufficient protection to the workers for safety is of concern to us. I believe one can achieve this by adding after ‘and to the extent of his control’ the words ‘in so far as the particular matters hereinafter set out relate to and are within his control’. In that way one can focus on the scope of his control for the particular purpose for which he has to exercise that control’: <core:emph typestyle="it">Mason v Satelcom Ltd</core:emph>

Therefore the owner was not under the duty (under regs 8 and 9) to ensure that those workers who did use it had received information, instructions and training. In <core:emph typestyle="it">Mason</core:emph>, a key holder to a locked room in which a worker found and used a ladder was held to have control of the ladder. However, the key holder had no control of the worker nor of whether or how he used the ladder. The key holder's control meant it was under a duty to maintain the ladder (reg 5), but this did not extend to ensuring that the ladder was suitable for the use the worker made of it (reg 4).

                           <core:para>Regulation 4 gives effect to Article 3(1) of the Work Equipment Directive. Its aim is to ensure that work equipment which is made available to workers may be used by them without impairment to their safety or health.

That there have been no previous similar accidents does not mean that an accident is not reasonably foreseeable to those required to consider the risks posed by the use of the equipment. <core:emph typestyle="it">Robb v Salamis (M &amp; I) Ltd</core:emph> involved a fall from a ladder that was not properly positioned in its retaining brackets. It was reasonably foreseeable that a person falling from the ladder if it were unsecured would suffer injury. Therefore whether the ladder was suitable depended upon whether it was reasonably foreseeable that someone might fail to position the ladder in its retaining brackets. Such a possibility had to be considered as a matter of generality. The precise circumstances in which the ladder came to be wrongly placed need not be foreseen. The carelessness of those who use or interact with the equipment should also be considered. Therefore carelessness in repositioning the ladder should be considered when considering if the ladder was suitable for whoever next used it.

In view of the later decision in <core:emph typestyle="it">Robb v Salamis (M &amp; I) Ltd</core:emph> it is questionable whether this case was rightly decided.

In the opinion of Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, if it had been intended to create protection against any accident at work due to the use of work equipment, that is to say an absolute guarantee of protection without reference to foreseeability, the Article would have been framed differently.

                              </lnci:cite>, David Steel J said, at para 16: ‘The regulation imposes an obligation to guard against foreseeable risk, not an absolute obligation to guard against or be responsible for any risk that in fact eventuates’. ‘Reasonably foreseeable’ does not mean ‘more likely than not’. It connotes a greater measure of foreseeability than mere possibility and what was reasonably foreseeable was what would be foreseen by a reasonable man, who was neither over-confident nor over-apprehensive, with all the information available to him which was, or should have been, available to the relevant party. Accordingly reg 5(3) of the 1992 Regulations (now reg 4(3) of the 1998 Regulations) requires the absence of reasonably foreseeable risk of material harm, meaning harm to any person which was more than de minimis: <core:emph typestyle="it">Moohan v Glasgow City Council</core:emph>

Having regard to the terms of Article 3.1, he held that reg 5 (now reg 4) should be interpreted so as to cover not only the suitability of a meat slicing machine for the purpose of slicing meat safely, but also its suitability for being cleaned safely. The duties imposed under the Regulations are not mutually exclusive and may overlap. Therefore the exposed blade of the slicing machine can be a breach of reg 4 as well as reg 11.

                              </lnci:cite>, reg 4(2) implements the second paragraph of Article 3.1 of the 1989 Work Equipment Directive. It requires that a risk assessment be carried out before the work equipment is used by or provided for use by persons whose health or safety may be at risk. The scope of the risk assessment exercise is no less exacting than that required at common law. The aim is to identify the risks to the health and safety of workers if things go wrong. Such should be considered as a matter of generality. The employer must anticipate that it may not be possible to predict the precise ways in which situations of risk may arise, especially where the risk is created by carelessness. The employer is liable even if he did not foresee the precise accident that happened. The fact that an accident was caused by a known source of danger but in a way that could not have been foreseen affords no defence: <core:emph typestyle="it">Robb v Salamis (M &amp; I) Ltd</core:emph>.

                           <core:para>These words must be interpreted broadly, bearing in mind that the question is whether the work equipment is suitable.

Lord Clyde, at para 42, commented that it may refer to the use of work equipment in factual conditions other than those in which it was provided to be used. The ACOP advises that work equipment be installed, located and used in such a way as to reduce risks to users of work equipment and for other workers. For instance the equipment's moving parts should be in sufficient free space to prevent contact. All forms of energy used or produced by the equipment and all substances used or produced by it should be capable of being supplied to it and/or removed from it in a safe manner.</core:para>

In rejecting this argument, the Court held that while the focus of the PPE Regulations was on protection against particular risks, the focus of the 1992 Regulations was on general considerations of safety, and protection against the broad risk of accidental injury inherent in the use of machinery. What is defective is to be judged against the state or condition in which the equipment was intended to be. In <core:emph typestyle="it">Stephen v Peter</core:emph>

For such a hazard to necessitate the provision of written instructions, the hazard needs to be of particular significance or potentially involve significant danger. The conditions, foreseeability, conclusions and experience referred to in paragraph (3) refer to what is or ought to be known to the employer and not the manufacturer as it is the former who knows how the equipment is in fact used.

                           <core:para>The employer’s first responsibility is to take measures to ensure that the user’s exposure to risk from any of the hazards specified in para (3) is prevented. If to do so is not reasonably practicable, the second, and alternative, responsibility is to take measures to ensure that such exposure is adequately controlled. The measures required must, so far as is reasonably practicable, be additional to the measures already required, such as the provision of PPE (required under the PPE Regs) or the provision of information and instruction (under reg 8), training (under reg 9), and, if required, supervision. Whether a risk, which it is not reasonably practicable to prevent, is adequately controlled involves consideration of, first, the availability of measures to control exposure to the risk, second, the nature of the hazard and, third, the nature and degree of exposure to the risk. Where an employee has received information, instruction and training sufficient to prevent or adequately control his exposure to risk from a specified hazard but, unknown to the employer, he chooses to ignore it, then it may not have been reasonably practicable for the employer to have done more to prevent or adequately control the employee's exposure to the risk: <core:emph typestyle="it">Whitehead v Trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement</core:emph>

                              </lnci:cite>, Bodey J said (para 10) ‘Clearly the words “shall ensure” smack of absolute liability. However such a conclusion would be to ignore that the obligation (to ensure stabilisation) only arises where such is “necessary” for purposes of health or safety. This phraseology seems to me to introduce considerations of foreseeability, since a step is realistically only “necessary” when the mischief to be guarded against can be reasonably foreseen.’ In that case, the claimant was unable to prove that the unstabilised scaffold tower on which he was working when it was deliberately and maliciously pushed over by a colleague would not have been pushed over if it had been stabilised sufficient to guard against foreseeable risks which did not include being deliberately pushed over.

                           <core:para>In <core:emph typestyle="it">James Callander and Sons Ltd v Gallacher</core:emph> 1999 SCCR 788 (HCJ) an employee in a sawmill was injured as a result of cleaning a bandsaw which was still running. The saw had an off switch, but this stopped not only the saw but also the rest of the mill. The employer was convicted for failure to provide a machine which could be maintained while it was shut down. The employer appealed on the grounds that the saw had an off switch and so could have been cleaned while shut down. The HCJ refused the appeal. In considering whether or not the regulation was satisfied, it was not sufficient to look at the construction of the machine in isolation. It was necessary to have regard to the whole circumstances in which it was used. As it was not the practice to stop the entire process throughout the sawmill to carry out the simple maintenance operation on the saw, the employer had, in a practical sense, not provided a machine which could be stopped to carry out the maintenance operation. After the accident the employer fitted a metal scraper to the machine in consequence of which the operation which led to the accident was not required. This was held to be indicative of how easy it would have been to have complied with the regulation.</core:para>

                     <core:para>Regulation 8 sets out the general duty on ‘a responsible person’ not to place PPE on the market unless it satisfies certain requirements, including that it satisfies the basic health and safety requirements applicable to that type of PPE, that an appropriate conformity assessment has been carried out (see reg 11), and that it does not compromise the safety of individuals, domestic animals or property. The basic health and safety requirements are laid down in Sch 2. Under reg 9 no person must supply PPE unless that PPE is safe. A breach of regs 8 or 9 is an offence.</core:para>

                     <core:para>These Regulations implement Directive 2006/42/EC (the Machinery Directive) which, as from 29 December 2009, revokes and replaces Directive 98/37/EC which had been implemented in the UK by the Supply of Machinery (Safety) Regulations 1992, SI 1992/3063, which these Regulations revoke with effect from the same date. The Machinery Directive, as a ‘New Approach Directive’, seeks to harmonise national health and safety provisions applicable to products when first placed on the market or put into service in the EEA. Products which comply with the provisions are ‘CE’ marked and can be placed on the market and put into service throughout the EEA.</core:para>
                     <core:para>Parts 1 and 2 of the Regulations set out the scope of the Regulations. Part 3 sets out the key obligations on those who place machinery or partly-completed machinery onto the market or put it into service (referred to in the Directive as ‘manufacturers or their authorised representatives’ and in the Regulations as ‘responsible persons’). These obligations include ensuring the safety of products (by reference to the essential health and safety requirements set out in Part 1 of Sch 2) (regs 7–9); following a ‘conformity assessment procedure’ (regs 10–12); and documenting compliance with the requirements of the Directive in various ways (notably by drawing up an ‘EC declaration of conformity’ and affixing the CE marking to the product). Part 4 makes further provision about CE marking. Part 5 is concerned with the activities of ‘notified bodies’, whose function is to assess the conformity of products with the Regulations. Part 6 deals with enforcement. Part 7 makes consequential changes to or avoids overlaps with other pieces of legislation, as well as rectifying some technical drafting defects in other Regulations implementing other New Approach Directives. In particular, reg 25 amends the Lifts Regulations 1997, SI 1997/831, as required by the Machinery Directive.</core:para>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of Directives, minimum requirements designed to encourage improvements, especially in the working environment, to guarantee greater protection of the health and safety of workers;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, under the said Article, such Directives shall avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas this Directive constitutes a practical step towards the achievement of the social dimension of the internal market;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas collective means of protection shall be accorded priority over individual protective equipment; whereas the employer shall be required to provide safety equipment and take safety measures;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the requirements laid down in this Directive should not entail alterations to personal protective equipment whose design and manufacture complied with Community Directives relating to safety and health at work;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

The earlier Directive was the second individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16.1 of the Framework Directive (89/391/EEC). It was implemented in the UK by the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1992, SI 1992/2932. The 1989 Directive was amended by Directive 95/63/EC. The amendments were implemented by the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998, SI 1998/2306 which replaced the 1992 Regulations (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">

                     <core:para>These Regulations are intended to implement the Display Screen Equipment Directive 90/270 (para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.2201]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). The Regulations appear to protect temporary workers in conformity with the Temporary Workers Directive 91/383 (para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1429]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>), since the duties under the Regulations are not owed only by an employer to its employees (see, especially, reg 3; but cf regs 5 and reg 6). The Regulations were introduced under HSWA 1974, s 15 and consequently provisions of that Act are relevant to the interpretation of the Regulations. A breach of the Regulations gives rise to a potential criminal and civil liability: see HSWA 1974, ss 33(1) and 47(2).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations apply to all employment but not to: cabs for vehicles or machinery; display screen equipment on a means of transport or mainly for public operation, portables not in prolonged use, calculators and cash registers, and window typewriters (reg 1(4)). The Regulations draw a distinction between ‘operators’, defined as self-employed persons who habitually use display screen equipment as a significant part of their normal work (reg 1(2)(b)), and ‘users’, who are employees who habitually use that equipment as a significant part of their work (reg 1(2)(d)). The duties are not restricted to the display screen equipment but apply to ‘workstations’, which are an assembly comprising display screen equipment (in turn defined in reg 1(2)(a)), optional accessories, the surrounding equipment such as telephones, chairs and desks, and the immediate work environment around the display screen equipment (reg 1(2)(e)).</core:para>
                     <core:para>Following an amendment introduced in 2002, all workstations must comply with the requirements of the Schedule to the Regulations to the extent specified in para 1 of that Schedule (see reg 3 and the general note to that regulation), regardless of whether the equipment is used by users or operators. As well as laying down a general duty that the equipment must not be a source of risk for operators or users (see para 2(a)), the Schedule contains detailed provisions relating to the screen, keyboard, work surface, chair, space, lighting, reflections, glare, noise, heat, radiation, humidity, software and the like. No quantitative or qualitative checking facility must be used without the knowledge of the operators or users (para 4(b)).</core:para>
                     <core:para>In keeping with the general duty in para 2(a) of the Schedule, reg 2 places a duty on an employer to carry out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment of work stations used by users or provided by the employer and used for the purpose of its undertaking by operators. Risks are to be reduced to the lowest extent reasonably practicable (reg 2(3)). Periodic interruptions or changes of activity must be provided for users (but not operators) (reg 4). Eye and eyesight tests must be arranged and any special corrective appliance provided (reg 5). Training on health and safety aspects of the workstation is required for employees, and training in the event of a substantial modification is required for users (reg 6). Operators and users are to be given health and safety information about their workstations (reg 7).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations are not supplemented by any Approved Code of Practice but there is an extensive Guidance Note called ‘Display Screen Equipment Work’ (not reproduced in this work) which has no statutory admissibility in civil or criminal proceedings, though its recommendations were given significant consideration in interpreting reg 2 by the Court of Appeal in <core:emph typestyle="it">Fifield v Denton Hall Legal Services</core:emph>

                     <core:para>To the extent that the Regulations fail to give effect to the Directives they are intended to implement, the corresponding provisions of the Directives are relevant as an aid to interpretation; and against an emanation of the state a claimant may be able to rely directly on the provisions of the Directives (see ‘Interpretation in the light of the European Directives’ para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.9]</lnci:content>

                        </lnci:cite> ff in Part 2 interpretation of health and safety legislation). An example of possibly defective implementation is that Article 3(2) of the Directive requires that ‘employers shall take appropriate measures to remedy the risks found’, whereas reg 2(3) requires that ‘the employer shall reduce the risks … to the lowest extent reasonably practicable’. This appears to represent a shortfall in implementation since, whatever the distinction between the terms ‘appropriate’ and ‘reasonably practicable’, the regulation requires only reduction of risk and not the actual remedying of the risk required by the Directive. The Directive imposes a duty on the employer to consult with workers and/or their representatives (see Article 8). No equivalent duty is contained in the Regulations; but the employer's general duties to consult union safety representatives or worker representatives are probably sufficiently wide to include the matters covered by the Regulations (see the Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977 and Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996, reg 3).</core:para>

                        <core:para>Regulation 3 in its present form was introduced by the Health and Safety (Miscellaneous) Amendment Regulations 2002, SI 2002/2174. Unlike the earlier version, it is now not restricted to workstations used by ‘users’ or ‘operators’, and imposition of the duty no longer depends upon the date that the workstation was first put into service (in the original version an employer had until 31 December 1996 to comply with Sch 1 in relation to workstations put into service on or before 31 December 1992). The aim of this amendment is to give effect to the Display Screen Equipment Directive and Articles 4 and 5 in particular, which impose duties simply in relation to workstations. Certain provisions of Sch 1, however, continue to refer to ‘users’ and ‘operators’: see, for example, para 2. This appears to be in keeping with the Annex to the Directive, which refers in certain instances to ‘workers’.</core:para>

                     <core:para>These Regulations, along with the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998, were intended to implement Directive 95/63/EC which supplemented the first Work Equipment Directive 89/655/EEC. The 1989 and 1995 Directives have now been replaced by the second Work Equipment Directive 2009/104/EC (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[5.1057]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). HSE guidance and an ACOP have been published (<core:emph typestyle="it">Safe use of lifting equipment</core:emph> (L113)). The ACOP requires, amongst others things, that account should be taken of ergonomic risks when selecting lifting equipment. The equipment should be made of materials which are suitable for the conditions under which it will be used. Safe and suitable means access to or egress from any part of the lifting equipment should be provided if such access or egress is required. Where a person is required (eg for operational, maintenance or inspection purposes) to be present on any part of the lifting equipment, then that working place should be such as to minimise the risks of accidents arising from slips, trips and falls and should be of adequate size and strength for such persons and any items that need to be there. Edge protection should be provided where there is a risk of a person falling from the working place or where a risk of an object falling from the working place onto a person below. Where operators may be adversely affected by the environment in which they are using the lifting equipment, they should be provided with adequate protection. If the lifting equipment and/or its load may be affected by high wind, the equipment should be fitted with appropriate devices to detect dangerous situations and allow measures to be taken to cease using the equipment.</core:para>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1 edpnum-start="5.1843AP">These Regulations implement the European Parliament and Council Directive 97/23/EC (OJ No L181, 9.7.97, p 1) on the approximation of the laws of the member States concerning pressure equipment (‘the Directive’). They come into force on 29th November 1999 except regulations 1, 2, 20 and 22 which come into force on 31st August.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>For the purposes of the Regulations, relevant definitions are contained in regulation 2.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Part II provides for the application of the Regulations. They apply to pressure equipment and assemblies with a maximum allowable pressure PS greater than 0.5 bar (regulation 3).</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

                        <core:enum>(c)</core:enum>pressure equipment or assemblies placed on the market on or before 29th May 2002 if they comply with the safety provisions in force in the United Kingdom on 28th November 1999 and do not bear the CE marking (unless required by another Community Directive) or any indication of compliance with the Directive (regulation 6).</lnb-leg:para2>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Part III sets out the general requirements relating to the placing on the market or putting into service of pressure equipment and assemblies by a ‘responsible person’ (as defined). Pressure equipment and assemblies are not regarded as being put into service where a manufacturer or importer manufactures or imports that pressure equipment or assembly for his own use otherwise than in the course of business (regulation 2(3)). Pressure equipment or assemblies must satisfy the relevant essential requirements and be safe; in addition, the appropriate conformity assessment procedure (regulations 13 and 14) must have been carried out, unless the equipment is to be used for experimentation (regulation 15), a declaration of conformity drawn up in respect of the product, and the CE marking must have been affixed to the product by the ‘responsible person’ (regulations 7 and 8). Where pressure equipment or assemblies fall below the limits in regulations 7(2) and 8(2) the pressure equipment or assembly must be designed and manufactured in accordance with sound engineering practice, be accompanied by adequate instructions for use, bear markings to permit identification of the manufacturer or his authorised representative established within the Community, and be safe (regulation 9). Any person, other than the ‘responsible person’, who supplies pressure equipment or assemblies, must ensure that it is safe (regulation 10). Pressure equipment or assemblies shall not be regarded as being placed on the market or supplied in the circumstances described in regulation 11.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>The essential safety requirements are set out in Schedule 2, and in that connection, there is a definition of ‘relevant essential requirements’ in regulation 2. There is a presumption that the relevant essential requirements are met if the pressure equipment or assembly complies with transposed harmonised standards (regulations 7(3)(a) and 8(3)(a)(i) and (b)(i)). Regulation 13 describes the various conformity assessment procedures available in respect of pressure equipment (Schedule 4) as determined by the category into which the item of pressure equipment is classified (regulation 12). Regulation 14 describes the conformity assessment procedure for assemblies. The content of the EC declaration of conformity which is to be drawn up in respect of pressure equipment or assemblies is set out in Schedule 6. Requirements relating to the CE marking and other inscriptions for these products are set out in regulation 16 and Schedule 5. For the purposes of these Regulations there is a definition of ‘safe’ in regulation 2.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Regulation 18 describes a body which can be a ‘notified body’ for the purpose of these Regulations and regulation 19 describes a body which can be a ‘recognised third-party organisation’ for the purposes of these Regulations, and the provisions of regulation 20 relate to ‘notified bodies’ and ‘recognised third-party organisations’ appointed by the Secretary of State. Regulation 21 provides for the United Kingdom notified bodies to charge fees. Regulation 17 provides for the issue in accordance with Schedule 7 of European approvals for materials by notified bodies designated for that task. Regulation 22 provides for the appointment of ‘user inspectorates’ (as defined) to carry out specified conformity assessment procedures.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Regulation 23 describes the circumstances under which pressure equipment or assemblies might be taken to conform with the provisions of the Regulations.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Part IV and Schedule 8 provide for the enforcement of the Regulations. In Great Britain, the Health and Safety Executive are to enforce the Regulations in respect of pressure equipment and assemblies intended for use in the workplace and the weights and measures authorities are the enforcement authorities in respect of such products for private use; in Northern Ireland, the Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland is the enforcement authority for products intended for use in the workplace, and district councils are the enforcement authorities for products for private use. Except in the case of pressure equipment or assemblies which are considered to be unsafe, where an enforcement authority suspects that the CE marking has been incorrectly affixed to an item of pressure equipment or an assembly a notice may be served requiring compliance with the provisions of the Regulations; it is only following a breach of that notice that enforcement action can be taken in those circumstances. However, specific enforcement provisions can be used for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the CE marking has been correctly affixed. Any person who contravenes regulations 7, 8, 9 or 10 shall be guilty of an offence under regulation 25 and the penalties attracted by those offences are set out in regulation 26. A defence of due diligence is provided in regulation 27 and the liability of persons other than the principal offender is set out in regulation 28.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Some consequential amendments are made by regulation 29.</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

                     <core:para>These Regulations are intended to implement Council Directive 2002/44/EC on the minimum health and safety requirements regarding the exposure of workers to the risks arising from physical agents (vibration) (sixteenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations impose duties on employers to protect employees who may be exposed to risk from exposure to vibration at work, and other persons who might be affected by the work, whether they are at work or not. The Regulations apply to both hand-arm and whole-body vibration. They make provision for action values and limit values for daily exposure to vibration (reg 4); risk assessment (reg 5); elimination at source of exposure to vibration or, if elimination not reasonably practicable, reduction to as low a level as reasonably practicable (reg 6(1)); a programme of measures to be taken, when action values are reached to reduce exposure to vibration to as low a level as reasonably practicable (reg 6(2)); a prohibition on exceeding the limit values and action to be taken if that occurs (reg 6(4)); weekly averaging of exposure to vibration in specified circumstances (reg 6(5)); health surveillance (reg 7); and information, instruction and training (reg 8).</core:para>
                     <core:para>There are transitional periods for the commencement of the operation of regulation 6(4) concerning limit values. In the case of work equipment first provided before 6 July 2007 commencement was postponed until 6 July 2010 (reg 3(2)), and for whole-body vibration in agriculture and forestry it is postponed until 6 July 2014 (reg 3(3)).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations give powers to the HSE to grant exemptions from regulation 6(4) on limit values in respect of the activities of emergency services (reg 9) and in respect of whole-body vibration in the case of air transport (reg 10), and to the Secretary of State for Defence in respect of activities carried out in the interests of national security (reg 11).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations amend the Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction etc) Regulations 1996 and the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998.</core:para>

                           </lnci:cite>, the ECJ construed the phrase ‘graphic display screen’ in Article 2(a) widely so as to include screens which display film recordings. In the same vein it also held that the exemption of ‘control cabs for…machinery’ in Article 1(3) should be construed narrowly, with the consequence that it did not apply to workstations at which film cutters worked. The ECJ was reinforced in its view because of the length of time the cutters spent working at the screen.</core:para>

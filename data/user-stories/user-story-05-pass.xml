A legitimate child born in the lifetime of his father takes the domicile of the father; a legitimate child born after the death of his father, or an illegitimate child, takes the domicile of his mother. When the father and mother are living apart the child's dependent domicile is that of his mother if he then has his home with her and has no home with his father.

                  <core:enum>(6)</core:enum>The Council, by an Act dated 28 May 1998, drew up a Convention on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and recommended it for adoption by the Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional rules. Continuity in the results of the negotiations for conclusion of the Convention should be ensured. The content of this Regulation is substantially taken over from the Convention, but this Regulation contains a number of new provisions not in the Convention in order to secure consistency with certain provisions of the proposed regulation on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.</lnb-leg:para1>

                  <core:enum>(7)</core:enum>In order to attain the objective of free movement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility within the Community, it is necessary and appropriate that the cross-border recognition of jurisdiction and judgments in relation to the dissolution of matrimonial ties and to parental responsibility for the children of both spouses be governed by a mandatory, and directly applicable, Community legal instrument.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(8)</core:enum>The measures laid down in this Regulation should be consistent and uniform, to enable people to move as widely as possible. Accordingly, it should also apply to nationals of non-member States whose links with the territory of a Member State are sufficiently close, in keeping with the grounds of jurisdiction laid down in the Regulation.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(9)</core:enum>The scope of this Regulation should cover civil proceedings and non-judicial proceedings in matrimonial matters in certain States, and exclude purely religious procedures. It should therefore be provided that the reference to âcourtsâ includes all the authorities, judicial or otherwise, with jurisdiction in matrimonial matters.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(10)</core:enum>This Regulation should be confined to proceedings relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment. The recognition of divorce and annulment rulings affects only the dissolution of matrimonial ties; despite the fact that they may be interrelated, the Regulation does not affect issues such as the fault of the spouses, property consequences of the marriage, the maintenance obligation or any other ancillary measures.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(11)</core:enum>This Regulation covers parental responsibility for children of both spouses on issues that are closely linked to proceedings for divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(12)</core:enum>The grounds of jurisdiction accepted in this Regulation are based on the rule that there must be a real link between the party concerned and the Member State exercising jurisdiction; the decision to include certain grounds corresponds to the fact that they exist in different national legal systems and are accepted by the other Member States.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(13)</core:enum>One of the risks to be considered in relation to the protection of the children of both spouses in a marital crisis is that one of the parents will take the child to another country. The fundamental interests of the children must therefore be protected, in accordance with, in particular, the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of the International Abduction of Children. The lawful habitual residence is accordingly maintained as the grounds of jurisdiction in cases where, because the child has been moved or has not been returned without lawful reason, there has been a de facto change in the habitual residence.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(14)</core:enum>This Regulation does not prevent the courts of a Member State from taking provisional, including protective, measures, in urgent cases, with regard to persons or property situated in that State.</lnb-leg:para1>

                  <core:enum>(15)</core:enum>The word âjudgmentâ refers only to decisions that lead to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment.

                  <core:enum>(16)</core:enum>The recognition and enforcement of judgments given in a Member State are based on the principle of mutual trust. The grounds for non-recognition are kept to the minimum required. Those proceedings should incorporate provisions to ensure observance of public policy in the State addressed and to safeguard the rights of the defence and those of the parties, including the individual rights of any child involved, and so as to withhold recognition of irreconcilable judgments.</lnb-leg:para1>

                  <core:enum>(1)</core:enum>The European Community has set the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. To this end, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters that are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(2)</core:enum>The Tampere European Council endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions as the cornerstone for the creation of a genuine judicial area, and identified visiting rights as a priority.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(3)</core:enum>Council Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000 sets out rules on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility for the children of both spouses rendered on the occasion of the matrimonial proceedings. The content of this Regulation was substantially taken over from the Convention of 28 May 1998 on the same subject matter.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(4)</core:enum>On 3 July 2000 France presented an initiative for a Council Regulation on the mutual enforcement of judgments on rights of access to children.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(5)</core:enum>In order to ensure equality for all children, this Regulation covers all decisions on parental responsibility, including measures for the protection of the child, independently of any link with a matrimonial proceeding.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(6)</core:enum>Since the application of the rules on parental responsibility often arises in the context of matrimonial proceedings, it is more appropriate to have a single instrument for matters of divorce and parental responsibility.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(7)</core:enum>The scope of this Regulation covers civil matters, whatever the nature of the court or tribunal.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(8)</core:enum>As regards judgments on divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, this Regulation should apply only to the dissolution of matrimonial ties and should not deal with issues such as the grounds for divorce, property consequences of the marriage or any other ancillary measures.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(9)</core:enum>As regards the property of the child, this Regulation should apply only to measures for the protection of the child, ie (i) the designation and functions of a person or body having charge of the child's property, representing or assisting the child, and (ii) the administration, conservation or disposal of the child's property. In this context, this Regulation should, for instance, apply in cases where the parents are in dispute as regards the administration of the child's property. Measures relating to the child's property which do not concern the protection of the child should continue to be governed by Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(10)</core:enum>This Regulation is not intended to apply to matters relating to social security, public measures of a general nature in matters of education or health or to decisions on the right of asylum and on immigration. In addition it does not apply to the establishment of parenthood, since this is a different matter from the attribution of parental responsibility, nor to other questions linked to the status of persons. Moreover, it does not apply to measures taken as a result of criminal offences committed by children.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(11)</core:enum>Maintenance obligations are excluded from the scope of this Regulation as these are already covered by Council Regulation No 44/2001. The courts having jurisdiction under this Regulation will generally have jurisdiction to rule on maintenance obligations by application of Article 5(2) of Council Regulation No 44/2001.</lnb-leg:para1>
               <lnb-leg:para1>
                  <core:enum>(12)</core:enum>The grounds of jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility established in the present Regulation are shaped in the light of the best interests of the child, in particular on the criterion of proximity.

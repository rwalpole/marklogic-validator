This consumer code sets out standards that subscribers will comply with regarding advertising, new car provisions, car manufacturer’s warranties, availability of replacement parts and complaints handling.</core:para>
                  <core:para>Subscribers are obliged to accept the Code in its entirety and ensure that their staff are aware of their legal responsibilities as well as their responsibilities under this Code.</core:para>
                  <core:para>A consumer who feels dissatisfied with a subscriber’s performance under any item covered by this Code is able to submit their grievance to the Conciliation and Advisory Service. A detailed procedure explaining how to do this appears in the Appendix.</core:para>
                  <core:para>The principles set out in this Code are not intended to interpret, qualify or supplement the law, and are not intended to be applied to non-consumer sales.</core:para>

                  <core:para>This Code has been developed by the motor industry to provide a self regulatory regime by which vehicle manufacturers can demonstrate their intention to operate as responsible businesses and have in place a cost-effective and speedy dispute resolution service that consumers can readily access in the event of a disagreement.</core:para>
                  
                  <core:para>The Brief Guide contains information on the Code, the Consumer Advice Line, Conciliation and Arbitration, as well as a pre-contractual information check list and the Consumer Survey.</core:para>
                  <core:para>It must be remembered that the consumer also has a part to play, by co-operating fully with those who make, sell and maintain cars by familiarising themselves with their car’s owners manual and ensure the car is maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations.</core:para>
                  <core:para>The Code also includes helpful tips and guidance for each section, headed ‘We would advise you to’.</core:para>

                        <core:para>If satisfaction has not been obtained through contact with other management or staff, the named person should be contacted and provided with the information that will enable them to investigate the situation. To reduce the possibility of any misunderstanding or confusion, it is recommended that the customer should record their concerns in writing providing details of the vehicle, the work and date the work or services were provided and the specific reasons for dissatisfaction together with details of any previous contacts that have been made in an attempt to resolve the problem. The Company should respond within seven working days outlining the course of action they propose to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</core:para>
                        <core:para>If after exhausting the above procedure the dissatisfaction remains the customer can refer it to the Conciliation and Arbitration service – for details see later.</core:para>
                        <core:para>If a customer refers a complaint to a Trading Standards Officer, Consumer Advice Centre, Citizens Advice Bureau or any other similar organization or body VBRA members should cooperate positively with that body by providing the relevant information to facilitate a speedy resolution.</core:para>

                  <core:para>Within the realms of the automotive world, Bosch has been just as active and has supplied a variety of automotive products and systems to vehicle manufacturers for over 100 years.</core:para>
                  <core:para>Bosch is no stranger to the after-market either. In the UK, Bosch has operated approved repairer schemes for over fifty years. For the consumer this experience has culminated in the Bosch Car Service programme.</core:para>
                  <core:para>The Bosch Car Service (BCS) programme is in essence the bringing together of all the benefits offered by a reputable local garage combined with the support and expertise available from Bosch, a global supplier of automotive technology.</core:para>
                  <core:para>The BCS network is made up of selected independent garages that are able to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to the highest levels of technical and customer service. Bosch Car Service appointments are typically family run garages where the owner or proprietor is directly involved in the day to day running of the business.</core:para>
                  <core:para>BCS garages will, as standard, participate in a programme of quality and performance checks to ensure prescribed standards are maintained.</core:para>
                  
                  <core:para>You can recognise a Bosch Car Service garage by its distinctive building facia signage which features the words Bosch Car Service along with the blue, black and red Bosch Car Service logo.</core:para>

                  <core:para>This Code has been fully approved by the Trading Standards Institute (TSI) and is therefore authorised to use the TSI logo. Approval of the Code by the TSI is your assurance that BCS garages are committed to offering the highest standards of customer service.</core:para>
                  <core:para>BCS garages are required to comply with the provisions of this Code. These provisions specify how a variety of customer handling measures and trade practices are to be conducted to the benefit of the customer.</core:para>
                  <core:para>BCS garage staff will receive training which enables the provisions of this Code to be put into practice, thus ensuring that the consumer is provided with the best possible service.</core:para>
                  <core:para>We also appreciate that despite the best efforts and intentions of the BCS garage, it is possible that a customer may nevertheless feel dissatisfied with the service they have received. So our Code includes procedures to enable such situations to be dealt with fairly, speedily and at minimal cost.</core:para>
                  <core:para>The procedures outlined in this Code are additional to the legal rights assured to the consumer and the content of this Code is not intended to detract from such laws and remedies.</core:para>

                  <core:para>A detailed procedure explaining how to do this appears in the Appendix as do the terms of reference for dispute resolution and disciplinary action.</core:para>

                  <core:para>The Code sets out standards that subscribers will comply with regarding:</core:para>
                  <core:para>Advertising</core:para>
                  <core:para>Point of Sale Obligations</core:para>

                  <core:para>Subscribers manage the registration, claims handling and aftersales on behalf of motor manufacturers, motor traders and/or insurers and where sold directly by the subscriber to the consumer, the sale of the product.</core:para>
                  <core:para>Subscribers are obliged to accept the Code in its entirety and ensure that their staff are aware of their legal responsibilities as well as their responsibilities under the Code. Subscribers will ensure that they meet all requirements laid down by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) for individuals concerned in insurance mediation and any other statutory requirements.</core:para>
                  <core:para>Subscribers are reminded that in the event of any conflict between the Code and FCA rules, that the FCA rules take precedence over the Code for insurance products.</core:para>
                  <core:para>A consumer who feels dissatisfied with a subscriber’s performance under any item covered by this Code is able to submit their grievance to the Code Advisory and Conciliation Service. A detailed procedure explaining how to do this appears in the Appendix of this Code.</core:para>
                  <core:para>Subscribers and retailers are required to use reasonable endeavours to ensure that consumers understand the products offered. If it appears to subscribers or retailers that a consumer may not understand a particular point, either prior to purchase or when making a claim, they should take reasonable steps to help the consumer understand. Particular care will be taken with vulnerable/disadvantaged consumers; advice will be given in a helpful, patient and appropriate manner. Retailers will give clear product information and explanations to make sure this is the case.</core:para>
                  <core:para>A consumer information leaflet to accompany the Code, the Brief Guide to the Motor Industry Code of Practice for Vehicle Warranty Products (‘the Brief Guide’), is available to download from <core:url address="www.motorcodes.co.uk" type="http">www.motorcodes.co.uk</core:url>.</core:para>

More serious incidences will result in a written warning detailing what corrective action must be taken and by when. If appropriate, such serious incidences shall also result in a follow up compliance visit or mystery shop, the cost of which shall be borne by the member. A very serious breach or persistent minor breaches of the Code will result in a member being called before a Disciplinary Committee which may, if it sees fit, expel the Member from participation in the Code. The member has the right to be accompanied and/or represented at the hearing. There is no right of appeal. In the event of expulsion, the Member may not re-apply for membership before two years has elapsed and the cause of the expulsion been properly addressed.</core:para>

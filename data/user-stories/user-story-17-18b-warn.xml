                     <core:para>This Act is largely based upon the Report of the Robens Committee on Safety and Health at Work (1972 Cmnd 5034), which recommended the reorganisation of the statutory provisions on health and safety at work in a single comprehensive Act which should include an enunciation of the basic responsibilities of employers and employees. The expressed objects of Part I of the Act are (s 1) to secure the health, safety and welfare of persons at work; to protect persons other than persons at work against risks to health or safety arising out of or in connection with the activities of persons at work; and to control the keeping and use of explosive or highly flammable or otherwise dangerous substances and generally to prevent the unlawful acquisition, possession and use of such substances. These objects are to be accomplished by the progressive replacement of existing statutory provisions, the multiplicity of which was criticised by the Robens Committee, by a system of regulations and approved codes of practice operating in combination with the other provisions of Part I of the Act and designed to maintain or improve the standards of health, safety and welfare established under the pre-existing legislation.</core:para>
                     <core:para>To this end, the Act contains power to repeal or modify the existing statutory provisions (see s 15) and this power has already been exercised over a wide field. In particular, provisions of the Factories Act 1961 itself have been repealed or modified. Thus, by the Factories Act 1961, etc (Repeals and Modifications) Regulations 1974, SI 1974/1941, certain enforcement powers, exercised under the 1961 Act, were transferred to the new Health and Safety Executive, the functions of factory inspectors were transferred to inspectors appointed by that Executive under the HSWA 1974, penalties prescribed by the HSWA 1974 were made to apply (with certain exceptions) to offences committed under the 1961 Act and powers and provisions of the 1961 Act with respect (for example) to the making of subordinate legislation were repealed, having been superseded by powers and provisions of the HSWA 1974.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The provisions of the HSWA 1974 relating to health, safety and welfare in connection with work are principally contained in Part I (ss 1–54). Part II (ss 55–60) concerns the Employment Medical Advisory Service, which had been constituted under the Employment Medical Advisory Service Act 1972. Part III (ss 61–76) modified the law relating to building regulations under ss 61 and 62 of the Public Health Act 1936; its sections were repealed by the Building Act 1984, s 133(2). Part IV (ss 77–85) contains miscellaneous and general provisions. Much of that Part has been repealed. In force, however, is s 80, which includes a sweeping power to repeal or modify, by regulation, any provision: (i) of the HSWA 1974; (ii) of any other Act passed before or in the same session as the HSWA 1974; (iii) contained in any regulations, instrument or order made under an Act before the passing of the HSWA; and (iv) certain other provisions, including those of the Employment Rights Act 1996 if it appears expedient to do so in consequence of or in connection with any provision made by or under Part I of the HSWA 1974.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The HSWA 1974 applies to employment generally, and not to specific categories of employment only. It applies to persons in the service of the Crown (s 48) and, following the Police (Health and Safety) Act 1997, to the police (s 51A). The duties of an employer towards his employees are statutorily prescribed in general terms (s 2(1), (2)) and obligations concerning the preparation by employers of statements of policy with regard to health and safety in employment (s 2(3)) and concerning consultations with employees' representatives (s 2(6)) are imposed (which have been amplified in regulations). General duties with regard to the safety of persons other than employees are also imposed upon employers and the self-employed (s 3) and upon persons having control of non-domestic premises (s 4). Duties are placed on designers, manufacturers, importers and suppliers of articles for use at work in relation to the safety of such articles (s 6). Employees are required to take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and others (ss 7, 8).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The HSWA 1974 established the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive in the original s 10. The two bodies were abolished by the Legislative Reform (Health and Safety Executive) Order 2008, SI 2008/960, and replaced with a single body called the Health and Safety Executive (article 4 of the Order, substituting a new s 10 in HSWA 1974). This body is referred to as the ‘Executive’ in HSWA 1974, and its constitution is set out in HSWA 1974, Sch 2. Under the ultimate control of the Secretary of State (s 12), the Executive must (by s 11) do such things and make such arrangements as it considers appropriate for the general purposes of Part I. The general functions and powers of the Executive are specified in ss 11, 13, 14 and 16. In particular, the Executive is empowered to direct investigations and inquiries (s 14) and to approve and issue codes of practice for the purpose of providing practical guidance with respect to the requirements of any statutory provision relating to health and safety at work (s 16). A failure to observe a provision of such a code of practice does not of itself give rise to liability, but may in criminal proceedings be relied upon as evidence of a failure to observe a statutory requirement or prohibition (s 17). As a result of the Railways Act 2005. s 2, the former Commission's functions in relation to railway safety were transferred to the Office of Rail Regulation.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Robens Committee recommended the establishment of a single health and safety inspectorate. The HSWA 1974 empowers every enforcing authority, which means the Executive or other authority responsible for enforcement such as a local authority (s 18(7)), to appoint inspectors (s 19) whose powers are widely defined (ss 20–25). Particularly to be noted are the powers to issue improvement and prohibition notices (ss 21–23), requiring the remedying of a contravention of statutory provisions or directing the cessation of activities giving rise to risk of serious personal injury, and the power to deal with a cause of imminent danger of serious personal injury owing to the presence of articles in the premises which an inspector has power to enter (s 25).</core:para>
                     <core:para>Save to the extent that it defines the general duties of employers and others in relation to health and safety at work (ss 2–8) the HSWA 1974 contemplates the achievement of its aims by the approval and issue of codes of practice by the Executive, and by the making of regulations by the Secretary of State (s 15). Health and safety regulations may be made for any of the purposes specified in Sch 3, and in particular, may repeal or modify any of the existing statutory provisions (s 15(3)). Regulations passed under the HSWA now set out the core specific duties which apply to employers and others; they include the key regulations introduced to give effect to the requirements of European Law, such as the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992, the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998, the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, the Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 and the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992.</core:para>
                     <core:para>A failure to comply with ss 2–7, or a contravention of s 8, gives rise to no civil remedy (s 47(1)(a)) but it is expressly provided that the breach of duty imposed by health and safety regulations or agricultural health and safety regulations, in so far as it causes damage, is actionable except in so far as the regulations provide otherwise (s 47(2)). A breach of almost all the regulations introduced under s 15 do potentially give rise to civil liability (for an exception, see reg 22 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999).</core:para>

                                 </lnci:cite>, the Court of Appeal rejected an argument that if the ‘directing mind’ of the company had taken all reasonable precautions then there was no breach of the duty in s 2: the offence could be committed even though senior management took all reasonable precautions, so that the offence was made out when, on the facts, there was a failure at store management level. The court thus adopted the same approach applied by the Court of Appeal to s 3 in <core:emph typestyle="it">R v British Steel plc</core:emph>

                                 </lnci:cite>, but left open the question, however, of whether the statutory defence would not apply whenever any employee failed to take reasonable precautions in the course of his employment.

                                 </lnci:cite>, the Court of Appeal held that the question of what is reasonably practicable is a question of fact, but an employer is not precluded from relying on the qualification merely because an employee carrying out the work was careless or omitted to take a precaution on a single occasion. It was sufficient for the employer to show that everything reasonably practicable had been done to ensure that a person doing the work had appropriate skill and instruction, has had safe systems of work laid down, has been subject to adequate supervision and has been provided with safe plant and equipment. Hence the issue of reasonable practicability should have been left to the jury in proceedings under s 3, where a gas fitter had failed to place a cap on the end of a gas pipe. Regulation 21 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">

In that case a specialist independent contractor using its own workers was engaged by the defendants to repair the lining of a tank on the defendants' chlorine plant. Applying the provision to the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, s 2(1), the House of Lords ruled that any reasonable jury would find that these activities did amount to the conduct of the defendants' undertaking having regard to the following facts: the tank was part of the defendants' plant; the work was planned by the defendants; the workers were almost permanently integrated into its operations; the workers obtained authorisation to work from the defendants, which enabled the defendants to impose conditions on how the work was done; and the defendants provided the workers with safety equipment. Declining to lay down rigid rules, the House of Lords did not accept that any repair work would inevitably fall within the section; but the ‘place where the activity takes place will in the normal case be very important; possibly decisive’ (per Lord Hoffmann at 978–9).</core:para>

Allowing an appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the question of what is reasonably practicable is a question of fact, but an employer is not precluded from relying on the defence merely because an employee carrying out the work was careless or omitted to take a precaution. It was sufficient for the employer to show that everything reasonably practicable had been done to ensure that a person doing the work had appropriate skill and instruction, has had safe systems of work laid down, has been subject to adequate supervision and has been provided with safe plant and equipment. Regulation 21 of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">

The Court of Appeal held that reg 21, which removes a ‘defence’ based on the act or default of an employee, was inapplicable to the duties in HSWA 1974, ss 2 and 3 because in those sections reasonably practicable qualified the duty rather than operating as a defence. The same presumably applies to the term in this section (and see the notes on ‘reasonably practicable’ under HSWA 1974, ss 2–3).</core:para>

An employee who endangers himself or others in order to save or protect life may, in all the circumstances, be taking reasonable care. In some occupations, eg in the emergency services, this may often be the case. Forseeability is a relevant factor in establishing the scope and breach of duty. Where taking reasonable care involves the implementation of specific safety procedures, such procedures must be adopted with an appropriate level of urgency: <core:emph typestyle="it">Amos v Worcester City Council</core:emph>

In <core:emph typestyle="it">Vibixa</core:emph> it was said that because the general purposes of the HSWA 1974, for which regulations may be made under s 15, were the promotion of health, safety and welfare (see s 1), regulations could not be made for the purpose of protecting an employer against damage to its property or financial loss which it incurs as a result of a matter which is the subject of health and safety regulations (see paras 48–56, and the General note to HSWA 1974, s 47). Subsection (6)(e) was added by the Offshore Safety Act 1992, s 4(1), (6), but this amendment does not affect the punishment of an offence committed before 6 March 1992.</core:para>

                              <core:para>The inspectors primarily exert their influence to maintain the legal standards by visiting premises, informing, advising and seeking to persuade. The threat of an inspection is undoubtedly a powerful incentive to compliance. The inspectors have a battery of powers to enforce their authority without resorting to coercive penalties. These general powers include powers of entry (with a constable if ‘serious obstruction’ is apprehended); and, on entry, to examine, investigate, measure, photograph, record, take samples, dismantle, test and remove for testing. Inspectors can direct that things are left undisturbed pending investigation. They may require persons to give information and answer questions, and to provide facilities and assistance. They may require documents to be produced and may keep copies. There are various procedural safeguards in HSWA 1974, s 20. Obstructing an inspector is an offence: HSWA 1974, s 33(1)(h).

So breach of a duty of care in negligence is not enough by itself. An improvement notice requires the recipient to remedy the breach within a specified period not less than the time for appealing.

                              <core:para>Prohibition notices (s 22) are to be contrasted with improvement notices (s 21, see above). A prohibition notice may be served if the inspector forms the opinion that there is ‘risk of serious personal injury’. This opinion does not appear to require that the risk is thought to flow from breach of statutory duty, and negligence may be sufficient. The notice must state the opinion of risk of injury, the matters giving rise to the risk, and, if the risk arises from breach of statutory duty, the statutory provision. Reasons must be given in the notice. The notice, of course, specifies what activity is prohibited and when the prohibition is to come into effect.</core:para>

There is no specific relationship between turnover or net profit and the size of a fine, but any fine should reflect the means of the offender. The size of a company was not relevant to the standard of care expected of it. The objective of prosecutions for health and safety was to achieve a safe environment for workers and the public; fines should be large enough to convey that message to managers and shareholders but not generally so large as to put a company at risk of bankruptcy (though there may be offences so serious that the defendant ought not to be in business). Relevant factors include the degree of risk and extent of danger created by the offence; the extent of breach (whether it was an isolated incident or a continuing breach); and the defendant's resources and the effect of a fine on its business. Particular aggravating factors include failures to heed warnings and deliberate breaches with a view to profit. Loss of life is also an aggravating feature, the fine for which should reflect public disquiet at an unnecessary loss of life. A good safety record, remedial action, and early admissions of responsibility and a guilty plea are mitigating factors.

                              <core:para>The Sentencing Guidelines Council issued guidelines in February 2010 for the purpose of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, s 120, as to the sentencing for: (i) corporate manslaughter under the CMCHA 2007; and (ii) health and safety offences where the offence is a significant cause of death: see Sentencing Guidelines Council, <core:emph typestyle="it">Corporate Manslaughter and Health an d Safety Offences Causing Death</core:emph> (2010). The ‘definitive guideline’ applies to all sentences on or after 15 February 2010, regardless of when the offence was committed. It is the duty of every court to follow such guidelines unless the court is satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so (Coroners and Justice Act 2009, s 125). The guideline says that the appropriate fine where a health and safety offence causes death will seldom be less than £100,000 (para 24). The court should consider, first, the seriousness of the offence; second, any particular aggravating or mitigating factors; third, the nature, financial organisation and resources of the defendant; fourth, the consequences of a fine; and, lastly, other matters such as guilty plea, costs, publicity orders and remedial orders. Factors affecting seriousness include how common was the breach in the organisation and how far up in the organisation the breach went (para 6); aggravating factors include failure to heed warnings or cost-cutting at the expense of safety (para 7); mitigating factors include a prompt acceptance of responsibility and a good health and safety record (para 8). The means of a defendant are relevant to the level of fine, and the court should require information about the financial circumstances of the defendant (para 14). There should be no fixed correlation between the level of fine and turnover or profit, however, although the court should look carefully at these to assess the resources of the defendant (paras 15–16). In assessing financial consequences, the effect on shareholders and directors will not normally be relevant, whereas the effect on the performance of public services is relevant in accordance with <core:emph typestyle="it">R v Milford Haven Port Authority</core:emph>

Moreover, ‘in considering in a given case whether there has been neglect within the meaning of HWSA 1974, s 37(1) on the part of a particular director or other particular officer charged, the search must be to discover whether the accused has failed to take some steps to prevent the commission of an offence by the corporation to which he belongs if the taking of those steps either expressly falls within or should be held to fall within the scope of the functions of the office which he holds. In all cases accordingly the functions of the office of a person charged with a contravention of section 37(1) will be a highly relevant consideration for any judge or jury and the question whether there was on his part, as the holder of his particular office, a failure to take a step which could and should have been taken will fall to be answered in the light of the whole circumstances of the case including his state of knowledge of the need for action, or the existence of a state of fact requiring action to be taken of which he ought to have been aware’.

                                 </lnci:cite>, the Court of Appeal held that the concept of the ‘directing mind’ of the company had no application to the qualification of ‘reasonably practicable’ in HSWA 1974, s 2: the offence could be committed even though senior management took all reasonable precautions, so that the offence was made out when, on the facts, there was a failure at store management level.

                                 </lnci:cite>, Lord Lloyd adopted the definition of ‘personal injury’ in the Limitation Act 1980, s 38(1) as including ‘any diseases and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition’ for the purpose of a claim in negligence. Applying the common law test, the House of Lords held that pleural plaques—symptomless areas of fibrous thickening of the pleural membrane—were not personal injuries: see <core:emph typestyle="it">Johnston v NEI International Combustion Ltd</core:emph>

This was because regulations can only be made under s 15 for the general purposes of the HSWA 1974, which are the promotion of health, safety and welfare as set out in HSWA 1974, s 1, and which do not include the protection of property. The use of the present tense (‘so far as it causes damage’) may not preclude the launch of civil proceedings for an injunction to restrain an existing breach which, though it is not at that moment causing damage, is likely to cause damage in the future. In relation to Regulations intended to implement European Directives, the requirement to provide an effective remedy may mean that the remedy of injunction should not be excluded.</core:para>

                              <core:para>This amendment, introduced by the Police (Health and Safety) Act 1997, together with s 52(1)(bb), brings police officers under the umbrella of the HSWA 1974.

                                 </lnci:cite> the Court of Appeal, in deciding whether a lift was an installation for use ‘at work’ for the purpose of reg 2 of the Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 (made under HSWA), declined simply to transpose the definition in s 52, which applies to HSWA 1974, Part 1, into the Regulations. Such a transposition would impose an absolute obligation on an employer wherever the employee was working (see Pill LJ at [21]). Important factors were whether the employee was acting in the course of employment, where the equipment was used and the degree of control exercised over it by the employer. On the facts, when an employee used a lift at the end of the day's work, she was using the lift at work. A provision protecting employees ‘at work’ extends to protecting those not engaged in the particular process for which the relevant plant was designed (see <core:emph typestyle="it">Bolton Metropolitan Borough Council v Malrod Insulations Ltd</core:emph>

                           <core:para>The present medical understanding of the pathogenesis of mesothelioma is that it is most probably caused by a single asbestos fibre. It therefore follows that where a person who develops mesothelioma has been negligently exposed to asbestos by different tortfeasors, only one tortfeasor can have caused the mesothelioma. The limitations on present medical understanding mean that which tortfeasor was most probably responsible cannot be identified. Therefore, at common law, each tortfeasor who contributed to the risk of the disease is liable for it: <core:emph typestyle="it">Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">
                                 <lnci:content>[2002] UKHL 22</lnci:content>

                              </lnci:cite>. Each tortfeasor’s liability is, at common law, limited to the extent to which that tortfeasor increased the risk: <core:emph typestyle="it">Barker v Corus UK Ltd</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">
                                 <lnci:content>[2006] UKHL 20</lnci:content>

                                 <lnci:content>[2006] 2 AC 572</lnci:content>
                              </lnci:cite>. This means that where a tortfeasor cannot be traced or has no insurance or other means to meet its share of the liability, then the victim will be not be compensated for that part. Section 3 of the 2006 Act reverses the effect of <core:emph typestyle="it">Barker</core:emph> (but only in mesothelioma cases) and makes each tortfeasor jointly and severally liable for the whole injury, subject to any deduction for contributory negligence. The tortfeasor needs only to have caused a material increase in the risk of developing mesothelioma, this need not be a doubling of the risk: <core:emph typestyle="it">Sienkiewicz v Greif (UK) Ltd</core:emph> 
                              <lnci:cite type="case">

                              </lnci:cite>. In order to engage the provisions of the section, the tortfeasor’s liability still has to be proved, therefore where exposure is not in breach of duty or is only de minimis, then there is no liability for that exposure: <core:emph typestyle="it">Williams v University of Birmingham</core:emph>

                     <core:para>Section 1 of this Act (‘CMCHA 2007’) creates an offence of corporate manslaughter (in England, Wales and Northern Ireland) and corporate homicide (in Scotland); apart from the names, the offences are identical. The offence is committed if the way in which the activities of an organisation are managed or organised: (i) causes a person's death, and (ii) amounts to a gross breach of a ‘relevant duty of care’ owed to the deceased (s 1(1)). ‘Gross’ means a breach which falls far below what can be reasonably expected of an organisation in the circumstances (s 1(4)(b)). In addressing whether there was a gross breach of a relevant duty of care, a jury must consider whether the organisation failed to comply with health and safety legislation and may have regard to relevant health and safety guidance (s 8). By s 1(3), an organisation is only guilty of an offence, however, if the way in which its activities are managed or organised by its ‘senior management’, defined in s 1(4)(c), is a ‘substantial element’ in the breach (this last phrase is not defined).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The offence can be committed by a corporation, the public bodies listed in Sch 1, a police force, a partnership, a trade union or employers’ association (s 1(2) – and see the definitions in s 25). There is no immunity for corporations which are servants or agents of the Crown (s 11). Directors and senior management cannot be personally prosecuted under the Act, however, because s 18 of the Act expressly states that an individual cannot aid, abet, counsel or procure an offence of corporate manslaughter (although a director or manager may be personally prosecuted for offences under s 37, HSWA 1974).</core:para>
                     <core:para>‘Relevant duty of care’ is defined in s 2 and includes a duty owed in negligence to the employees or other persons working for an organisation or performing services for it (s 2(1)(a)). It also includes a duty owed as occupier of premises (s 2(1)(b)) and in connection with construction, maintenance or commercial activities (s 2(1)(c)). Certain duties of care relating to public policy, military activities, policing and law enforcement, emergencies and child protection and probation functions are not relevant duties of care (ss 3–7).</core:para>
                     <core:para>A prosecution may only be brought in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with the consent of the DPP (s 17). The penalty is an unlimited fine (s 1(6)); the Act provides no guidance as to the amount, which is a matter for the Sentencing Guidelines Council. It published Guidelines in February 2010 (see s 3). In addition, a court has power to issue a remedial order, requiring an organisation to take steps to remedy a breach or other deficiency (s 9), and a publicity order, requiring an organisation to publicise its conviction and other information (s 10). CMCHA 2007 abolishes the common law offence of gross negligence manslaughter in its application to corporations (s 20).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Act followed the Law Commission report,<core:emph typestyle="it"> Legislating the Criminal Code: Involuntary Manslaughter</core:emph> (Law Com No 237, March 1996) and the Home Office consultation paper published in 2000, <core:emph typestyle="it">Reforming the Law on Involuntary Manslaughter: the Government's Proposals</core:emph>. A draft Bill was presented in March 2005 but the Act was not enacted until 26 July 2007. The Act was passed in response to the failure of prosecutions of the common law offence of manslaughter. At common law it was necessary to identify some member of senior management whose gross negligence was identified with that of the company itself and to find that such an individual was grossly negligent and had the necessary <core:emph typestyle="it">mens rea</core:emph>. In practice, these requirements often proved insurmountable obstacles to successful prosecutions: see eg <core:emph typestyle="it">R v P &amp; O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd</core:emph>

                        </lnci:cite>, Scott Baker J. Whether the Act will overcome the deficiencies of the common law remains to be seen. A particular problem is the need to show, under s 1(3), that senior management played a substantial element in the breach. Concerns have been expressed that the level of fines under the Act will not be a sufficient deterrent. Finally, the absence of sanctions against individual directors or managers has been the subject of much criticism.</core:para>

                           <core:para>The Sentencing Guidelines Council issued guidelines in February 2010 for the purpose of s 120 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 as to the sentencing for: (i) corporate manslaughter under the CMCHA 2007; and (ii) health and safety offences where the offence is a significant cause of death: see Sentencing Guidelines Council, <core:emph typestyle="it">Corporate Manslaughter and Health and Safety Offences Causing Death</core:emph> (2010). The ‘definitive guideline’ applies to all sentences on or after 15 February 2010, regardless of when the offence was committed. It is the duty of every court to follow such guidelines unless the court is satisfied it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so (Coroners and Justice Act 2009, s 125). The guideline says that because the offence of corporate manslaughter requires a gross breach at senior level, the appropriate fine will seldom be less than £500,000 and may be measured in millions of pounds (para 24). The court should consider, first, the seriousness of the offence; second, any particular aggravating or mitigating factors; third, the nature, financial organisation and resources of the defendant; fourth, the consequences of a fine; and lastly other matters such as guilty plea, costs, publicity orders and remedial orders. Factors affecting seriousness include how common was the breach in the organisation and how far up in the organisation the breach went (para 6). Aggravating factors include failure to heed warnings or cost-cutting at the expense of safety (para 7); mitigating factors include a prompt acceptance of responsibility and a good health and safety record (para 8). The means of a defendant are relevant to the level of fine, and the court should require information about the financial circumstances of the defendant (para 14). There should be no fixed correlation between the level of fine and turnover or profit, however, although the court should look carefully at these to assess the resources of the defendant (paras 15–16). In assessing financial consequences, the effect on shareholders and directors will not normally be relevant, whereas the effect on the performance of public services is relevant in accordance with <core:emph typestyle="it">R v Milford Haven Port Authority</core:emph>

                     <core:para>Part 3 of this Act came into force on 1 October 2008. The Act implements the recommendations of the Hampton Review, <core:emph typestyle="it">Reducing Administrative Burdens: Effective Inspection and Practice</core:emph> (March 2005), the Macrory Review, <core:emph typestyle="it">Regulatory Justice: Making Sanctions Effective</core:emph> (November 2006) and the Government paper <core:emph typestyle="it">Next Steps on Regulatory Reform</core:emph> (July 2007). Part 3 gives a Minister power to introduce various civil sanctions as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. The sanctions may confer various powers on a ‘regulator’, defined to include the HSE (see s 37 and Sch 5), in relation to a ‘relevant offence’, which includes offences under the HSWA 1974 (see s 38 and Sch 6). The sanctions include fixed monetary penalties (s 39), discretionary requirements (eg to take such steps as the regulator may require: see s 42), stop notices (s 46), and enforcement undertakings (s 50). Other Parts of the Act are not included in this work.</core:para>

                     <core:para>These regulations replace and revoke the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992 (see reg 29) which can be found in earlier editions of this work. Like the 1992 Regulations, these Regulations are primarily intended to implement many of the provisions of the Framework Directive 89/391 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1401]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). They also implement some provisions of the Temporary Workers Directive 91/383 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1429]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>), of the Pregnant Workers Directive 92/85 (see regs 16–18 and the Directive at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1449]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>) and of the Protection of Young People at Work Directive 94/33 (see regs 3(3), (4) and 19 and the Directive at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[4.501]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>). They should therefore be construed in the light of these Directives; and against an emanation of the state a claimant may be able to rely directly on the provisions of the Directives (see paras <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.9]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite> and <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[2.36]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The Regulations were introduced in part under HSWA 1974, s 15 and consequently provisions of that Act are relevant to the interpretation of the Regulations. A breach of the Regulations gives rise to potential criminal liability (HSWA 1974, s 33(1)) and, save to the extent the Regulations provide otherwise, civil liability (HSWA 1974, s 47(2)). Regulation 22 originally excluded civil liability for breach of almost all the duties. Although some commentators considered that the exclusion of civil liability amounted to defective implementation of the Framework Directive, such an argument was rejected in the first instance decision of Lord Macfadyen in <core:emph typestyle="it">Cross v Highlands and Islands Enterprises</core:emph>

                        <lnci:cite type="case">

                           <lnci:content>[2007] 2 All ER 97</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>, Lord Hope at [13] reserved his opinion on whether a breach of the regulations could give rise to civil liability (and see Part 2A at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">

                     <core:para>The Regulations are supplemented by an ACOP made under HSWA 1974, s 16(1), <core:emph typestyle="it">Management of Health and Safety at Work</core:emph> (L21, 2000). The same document contains guidance on the Regulations.</core:para>
                     <core:para>The central feature of these Regulations, marking a departure from the earlier law, is the duty imposed on employers to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks faced by employees at work and by other persons arising out of the conduct of the employer's undertaking (reg 3). The risk assessment must identify the measures which need to be taken to comply with statutory health and safety duties (reg 3(1)). The Regulations also lay down general duties relating to planning, organising, monitoring and reviewing preventive and protective measures (reg 5), providing health surveillance (reg 6), appointing competent persons to assist in undertaking health and safety measures (reg 7), establishing procedures in the event of serious and imminent danger (reg 8), and providing employees with information about health and safety risks (reg 10) and adequate training (reg 13). In addition, employers sharing a workplace are under duties of co-operation (reg 11) and duties are owed in relation to employees from outside organisations or working under fixed term contracts (regs 12 and 15). Employees must comply with their training and instructions (reg 14). Specific duties apply to new or expectant mothers and young persons (see regs 16–19).</core:para>
                     <core:para>The duties imposed under these Regulations are imposed even where compliance involves political decisions concerning military procurement or deployment of resources: <core:emph typestyle="it">Smith v Ministry of Defence</core:emph>

                        </lnci:cite>. In a new provision not contained in the 1992 Regulations, reg 4 of the 1999 Regulations requires that the preventive measures are implemented in accordance with a hierarchy of general principles set out in Sch 1, the first of which is to avoid the risk. This new duty appears to comply with Article 6 of the Framework Directive, identified as a potential shortfall in implementation in earlier editions of this work. Nevertheless, there remain areas where it is unclear if the relevant provisions of the Directives have been properly implemented. The Framework Directive, for example, requires an employer to be in possession of a risk assessment (Article 9), without conferring an exemption on employers of fewer than five employees (see reg 3(6)).The Temporary Workers Directive (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                           <lnci:content>[3.1429]</lnci:content>
                        </lnci:cite>) makes an undertaking using workers not employed by it responsible for their health and safety, a duty which may not be met by the Regulations the provisions of which often apply only to employers (see eg regs 5 and 13). In <core:emph typestyle="it">Cross v Highlands and Island Enterprises</core:emph> (above) Lord Macfadyen considered that the provisions of the Framework Directive did not confer rights on individuals for the purpose of the doctrine of direct effect, and Hughes J was of the same view <core:emph typestyle="it">obiter</core:emph> in <core:emph typestyle="it">Millward v Oxfordshire County Council</core:emph>

                        <core:para>This regulation implements Article 6(3) of the Framework Directive and sets out the important duty on employers and the self-employed to make risk assessments, identifying the measures needed to comply with statutory health and safety duties. The assessment must be kept under review (reg 3(3)). The assessment should no doubt include the risks of psychological as well as physical injuries. ‘How is the court to approach the question of what the employer ought to have known about the risks inherent in his own operations? … What the employer ought to have known will be what he would have known if he had carried out a suitable and sufficient risk assessment. Plainly, a suitable and sufficient risk assessment will identify those risks in respect of which the employee needs training. Such a risk assessment will provide the basis not only for the training which the employer must give but also for other aspects of his duty, such as, for example, whether the place of work is safe or whether work equipment is suitable …Risk assessments are meant to be an exercise by which the employer examines and evaluates all the risks entailed in his operations and takes steps to remove or minimise those risks. They should be a blueprint for action’: <core:emph typestyle="it">Allison v London Underground</core:emph>

                           </lnci:cite>, per LJ Smith at [58]. Consequently, what a suitable and sufficient risk assessment would have revealed will often be relevant to other duties owed by an employer, such as what training an employer ought to have provided under statute or at common law (see <core:emph typestyle="it">Allison</core:emph>, above). `The whole point of a proper risk assessment is that an investigation is carried out in order to identify whether the particular operation gives rise to any risk to safety and, if so, what is the extent of that risk, which of course includes the extent of any risk of injury, and what can and should be done to minimise or eradicate the risk’: <core:emph typestyle="it">Griffiths v Vauxhall Motors Ltd</core:emph>

                           </lnci:cite>, the court rejected an argument that it was negligent in 1993 to fail to conduct a risk assessment as this regulation requires. Since then, however, the courts have increasingly held that the duty to conduct a risk assessment under reg 3 is required by, or is relevant to, the duty expected of a reasonable employer, so that it is negligent not to conduct one: see <core:emph typestyle="it">Bailey v Command Security Services</core:emph>

Now that the exclusion of civil liability for breach of this and other regulations has been removed in relation to claims by employees against their employees (see reg 22), civil claims may be brought based on the breach of reg 3(1)(a) itself if the breach causes damage. The inadequacy of a risk assessment may not matter if those at risk were otherwise warned of it, but in the absence of a warning there may be a causal connection between the inadequate assessment and the injury arising from the risk: see <core:emph typestyle="it">McLellan v Dundee City Council</core:emph>

In order for breach of the duty to make a suitable and sufficient risk assessment to be the basis of a claim by an injured employee, the risks need to have been such as ought to have been identified by a suitable and sufficient assessment and thus to have given rise to a duty to combat those risks: <core:emph typestyle="it">Spencer v Boots the Chemist Ltd</core:emph>

But, with respect, the duty in reg 16(1) to carry out a risk assessment arises if the work could involve a risk to a new or expectant mother. It is only the duties to alter working conditions or hours of work (reg 16(2)) or to suspend employees to avoid risks (reg 16(3)) which require notification from the employee to trigger the duty (reg 18). The failure to carry out a risk assessment once the duty is triggered will constitute sex discrimination: see <core:emph typestyle="it">Hardman v Mallon</core:emph>

                           </lnci:cite>, on a prosecution for a breach of HSWA 1974, s 3, it was alleged that a gas fitter employed by the defendant failed to place a cap on a gas pipe. The judge directed the jury that if they found that the fitter had not capped the pipe, they could not find that the employer had done all that was reasonably practicable. Allowing an appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the question of what is reasonably practicable is a question of fact, but an employer is not precluded from relying on the defence merely because an employee carrying out the work was careless or omitted to take a precaution. It was sufficient for an employer to show that everything reasonably practicable had been done to ensure that the person doing the work had appropriate skills and instruction, that a safe system had been established, and that workers were subject to adequate supervision and were provided with proper plant and equipment. The regulation, it seems, aimed to reverse this decision. Despite that purpose, in <core:emph typestyle="it">R v HTM Ltd</core:emph>

                     <core:para>This Order abolished the Health and Safety Commission and the Health and Safety Executive and replaced them with a new body, called the Health and Safety Executive, which performs the functions of both former bodies. The Order operates by amending the HSWA 1974: the new s 10, HSWA 1974 established the body corporate known as the Health and Safety Executive, the functions of the Executive are set out in new s 11, its powers are set out in s 13 and additional provisions relating to its constitution and other matters are set out in new Schedule 2 to the HSWA 1974. The amendments are included in the text of the HSWA 1974 and not below. Schedule 3 to the Order also makes amendments to many other Acts and Regulations; these too are included in the amended legislation itself and not below.</core:para>

                        <core:para>This Directive (often referred to as `the Framework Directive’) provides the general framework of EU legislation in this area and led to the introduction of the individual ‘daughter’ Directives (see Article 16 at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                              <lnci:content>[3.1420]</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>). It was principally implemented in the UK by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992, SI 1992/2051, now the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                              <lnci:content>[3.831]</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>). The duties in this Directive on worker consultation led to amendments to the Safety Representatives and Safety Committees Regulations 1977, SI 1977/500; see especially reg 4A and ultimately the introduction of the Health and Safety (Consultation with Employees) Regulations 1996, SI 1996/1513. </core:para>
                        <core:para>The Directive requires that an employer evaluates the risks to health and safety of workers (Article 6), and be in possession of an assessment of such risks (Article 9). This requires that the employer assess all risks, and not just certain specific risks, to which workers are subject: see <core:emph typestyle="it">European Commission v Italy</core:emph>: C-49/00 <lnci:cite type="case">
                              <lnci:content>[2001] ECR I-8575</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>. In failing to ensure that employers of 10 or fewer workers possessed an assessment of risk, Germany breached the Directive: see <core:emph typestyle="it">European Commission v Germany</core:emph>: C5-000 <lnci:cite type="case">
                              <lnci:content>[2002] ECR I-1305</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>. In <core:emph typestyle="it">Cross v Highlands and Islands Enterprises</core:emph> 
                           <lnci:cite type="case">

                           </lnci:cite>, it was held that the Directive did not confer rights on workers which they could enforce by the doctrine of direct effect on the ground that the Directive set out general obligations on employers.

                           </lnci:cite>, the Court of Justice rejected a claim in infringement proceedings that the qualification of ‘so far as is reasonable practicable’ in HSWA 1974 was in breach of Article 5(1). It held that Article 5(1) was not intended to impose no-fault liability or a working environment with no risk. In <core:emph typestyle="it">Kmiecic v Isaacs</core:emph> 
                           <lnci:cite type="case">

                           </lnci:cite>, the recitals to the Directive, along with Article 1(1), were held to demonstrate that the obligations imposed under Articles 5 and 6 upon employees relate to the safety and health of workers at work and therefore do not require that such obligations be imposed upon a householder in relation to the skilled workers of a contractor whom the householder has engaged. To impose an obligation to ensure the safety of workmen upon those who are uneducated and unskilled in planning and preparing construction work would obstruct and impede the objectives of the Framework Directive and those Directives designed to implement them: see per Moses LJ at [16] and [22].</core:para>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of Directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to guarantee a better level of protection of the safety and health of workers;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas this Directive does not justify any reduction in levels of protection already achieved in individual Member States, the Member State being committed, under the Treaty, to encouraging improvements in conditions in this area and to harmonising conditions while maintaining the improvements made;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, pursuant to Article 118a of the Treaty, such Directives must avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the communication from the Commission on its programme concerning safety, hygiene and health at work provides for the adoption of Directives designed to guarantee the safety and health of workers;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the Council, in its resolution of 21 December 1987 on safety, hygiene and health at work, took note of the Commission's intention to submit to the Council in the near future a Directive on the organisation of the safety and health of workers at the workplace;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas in February 1988 the European Parliament adopted four resolutions following the debate on the internal market and worker protection; whereas these resolutions specifically invited the Commission to draw up a framework Directive to serve as a basis for more specific Directives covering all the risks connected with safety and health at the workplace;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Member States have a responsibility to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers on their territory; whereas taking measures to protect the health and safety of workers at work also helps, in certain cases, to preserve the health and possibly the safety of persons residing with them;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Member States' legislative systems covering safety and health at the workplace differ widely and need to be improved; whereas national provisions on the subject, which often include technical specifications and/or self-regulatory standards, may result in different levels of safety and health protection and allow competition at the expense of safety and health;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the incident of accidents at work and occupational diseases is still too high; whereas preventive measures must be introduced or improved without delay in order to safeguard the safety and health of workers and ensure a higher degree of protection;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, in order to ensure an improved degree of protection, workers and/or their representatives must be informed of the risks to their safety and health and of the measures required to reduce or eliminate these risks; whereas they must also be in a position to contribute, by means of balanced participation in accordance with national laws and/or practices, to seeing that the necessary protective measures are taken;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas information, dialogue and balanced participation on safety and health at work must be developed between employers and workers and/or their representatives by means of appropriate procedures and instruments, in accordance with national laws and/or practices;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the improvement of workers' safety, hygiene and health at work is an objective which should not be subordinated to purely economic considerations;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>

                        <core:para>This important Directive aims at protecting the health and safety of temporary workers, defined to mean workers with a fixed duration contract of employment and workers employed by an agency who are assigned to work for another undertaking (Article 1). It specifies that such workers must be given the same level of protection as other workers in the user undertaking and that the ‘daughter’ Directives shall apply in full to them (Article 2). Other Articles govern the provision of information, training and medical surveillance and lay down the duties of employment agencies and user undertakings. It ought to have been implemented by 31 December 1992.</core:para>
                        <core:para>Some of the duties in the Directive were implemented by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992, SI 1992/2051 (see now the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 at para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                              <lnci:content>[3.831]</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>). But in several instances other Regulations implementing the ‘daughter’ Directives do not appear to meet the requirements of the Temporary Workers Directive. The Manual Handling Regulations 1992 (see para <lnci:cite type="paragraph-ref">
                              <lnci:content>[6.1]</lnci:content>
                           </lnci:cite>), for example, only impose duties on employers towards their employees and not towards agency workers. Similarly and despite the wording of Article 2(2), the Personal Protective Equipment at Work Regulations 1992, SI 1992/2966 are restricted to the provision of such equipment by an employer to its employees and not others (reg 4). As a matter of UK law, the status of agency workers is unclear and confused: depending upon the particular circumstances: (i) they may not be employees at all, (ii) they may be employed only by the agency or, (iii) they may have an implied contract of employment with the user undertaking (see eg <core:emph typestyle="it">McMeechan v Secretary of State for Employment</core:emph>

                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European, Economic Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, drawn up after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at work,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>In cooperation with the European Parliament,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to protect the safety and health of workers;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas this Directive does not justify any reduction in levels of protection already achieved in individual Member States, the Member States being committed, under the Treaty, to encouraging improvements in conditions in this area and to harmonising conditions while maintaining the improvements made;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, under the terms of Article 118a of the Treaty, the said directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, pursuant to Decision 74/325/EEC, as last amended by the 1985 Act of Accession, the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health protection at Work is consulted by the Commission on the drafting of proposals in this field;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the Community Charter of the fundamental social rights of workers; adopted at the Strasbourg European Council on 9 December 1989 by the Heads of State or Government of 11 Member States, lays down, in paragraph 19 in particular, that:</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Every worker must enjoy satisfactory health and safety conditions in his working environment. Appropriate measures must be taken in order to achieve further harmonisation of conditions in this area while maintaining the improvements made;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the Commission, in its action programme for the implementation of the Community Charter of the fundamental social rights of workers, has included among its aims the adoption by the Council of a Directive on the protection of pregnant women at work;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas Article 15 of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work provides that particularly sensitive risk groups must be protected against the dangers which specifically affect them;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas pregnant workers, workers who have recently birth or who are breastfeeding must be considered a specific risk group in many respects, and measures must be taken with regard to their safety and health;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the protection of the safety and health of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding should not treat women on the labour market unfavourably nor work to the detriment of directives concerning equal treatment for men and women;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas some types of activities may pose a specific risk, for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding, of exposure to dangerous agents, processes or working conditions; whereas such risks must therefore be assessed and the result of such assessment communicated to female workers and/or their representatives;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, further, should the result of this assessment reveal the existence of a risk to the safety or health of the female worker, provision must be made for such worker to be protected;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas pregnant workers and workers who are breastfeeding must not engage in activities, which have been assessed as revealing a risk of exposure, jeopardising safety and health, to certain particularly dangerous agents or working conditions;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas provision should be made for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding not to be required to work at night where such provision is necessary from the point of view of their safety and health;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the vulnerability of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding makes it necessary for them to be granted the right to maternity leave of at least 14 continuous weeks, allocated before and/or after confinement, and renders necessary the compulsory nature of maternity leave of at least two weeks, allocated before and/or after confinement;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the risk of dismissal for reasons associated with their condition may have harmful effects on the physical and mental state of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding; whereas provision should be made for such dismissal to he prohibited;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas measures for the organisation of work concerning the protection of the health of pregnant workers, workers who, have recently given birth or workers who are breastfeeding would serve no purpose unless accompanied by the maintenance of rights linked to the employment contract, including maintenance of payment and/or entitlement to an adequate allowance;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas, moreover, provision concerning maternity leave would also serve no purpose unless accompanied by the maintenance of rights linked to the employment contract and or entitlement to an adequate allowance;</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
                     <lnb-leg:para-indented1>Whereas the concept of an adequate allowance in the case of maternity leave must be regarded as a technical point of reference with a view to fixing the minimum level of protection and should in no circumstances be interpreted as suggesting an analogy between pregnancy and illness,</lnb-leg:para-indented1>
